"You're handsome, just not my type."

That is what she actually said to me. Does she know what that means? It is
equivalent to my mom saying that I am handsome and that I will find a special
someone for sure.  I know she was just trying to be nice, but please. Do I look
like a little child? Do my feelings need protecting?

I smiled. "Thanks, Amy. You, on the other hand, are my type," I could not stop
myself from saying that, but I immediately felt like an idiot. What am I doing
ingratiating myself to her like that? I had to save it quick by being
unpleasant. "I think you are everyone's type."

She could have easily taken that last bit as an insult, the way I meant it.
Everyone's type, as in "you are a whore," or some other male chauvinist crap
like that. Very much _unlike_ me to say a thing like that. I regretted having
said it, it was a clear sign of strong emotions. Was I in love?

Luckily, she did not take it as an insult. Or at least did not let it show. She
smiled fabulously and said goodbye. I was left alone in front of a romantic
fountain, just standing there like an idiot.

But why like an idiot? I was just a human being standing by a fountain created
by human beings in a human city on the only planet in the universe that had
humans. I was right where I was supposed to be. And she never owed me anything.
I was just a fool for falling in love.

Never say that men "just say things," because when people speak, they also think
and feel. A lot.
