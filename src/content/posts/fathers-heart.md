I was with Jake and Amanda when she was giving birth. It was an abandoned
apartment building, a remnant of the previous administration,Â from back when the
world was full of people. I dragged an old mattress into a small apartment,
moved an old fridge to block the window and rigged some cables so that I could
connect a light.

It took Amanda three hours, but she finally gave birth.

"What is that?" I said.

The thing was pink and black, a part of it was open like a flower, a tiny
organic element reaching out to the world.

"It's not complete," said Jake. "It needs a heart. I need to find one fast."

"What do you mean?"

"Find a drifter or something. Any heart will do."

"Is that how it always is with you people?" I asked.

"Huh?"

"Nevermind," I said.

It did not matter. It was a new world, I had to learn the new rules.
