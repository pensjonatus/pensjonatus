That one night in Venice changed my life.

My laptop made the e-mail noise, so I lifted the lid and the ancient Venetian
hotel room filled with bright light from the display. The unread e-mail was
there, smack in the middle of the screen, waiting for me to read it, enticing me
with the subject line. "You won't believe it."

It said:

_Hi Michael,_

_I don't have to tell you how excited I am. I can't remember ever feeling that
way before, and I have you to thank. Your exhibit is making quite a splash and
it's all New York can talk about. I will tell you more once you return._

_Regards,_

_Uncle Dave_

I closed the laptop and let the dark of the room overwhelm me. I listened to the
quiet. Then I heard the shower next door, in Bianca's room.

My voluptuous step-mother Bianca was just over the wall. All day she had been
giving me smiles and looks, and I could not stop thinking about her. Presently,
she finished her shower and I the floor squeaked as she walked about her room.
She was so close to the door that separated us. The unlocked door.

But she did not try the handle. She just shuffled into bed. I could hear the
springs as she lay down. I sighed.

But then I saw _him_ outside the window. There was a man on the ledge. A man in
a black coat. A man with a revolver in his hand. He sneaked by. He disappeared
into the night. An assassin out for a kill. Luckily, I was not the mark.

And then it happened - aliens abducted me.
