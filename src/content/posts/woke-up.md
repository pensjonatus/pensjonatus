I woke up in the middle of the night and, for a second, I did not know which of
them was lying beside me. I pieced my mind back together slowly and figured out
I was away from home, in a strange apartment, after a whole day with girl B.

I met girl B several months before, but we never really talked too much. And
then, just when I was about to leave the place away from home, girl B asked me
to come back in a few days and come to a concert.

She was playing. I listened with interest and afterwards, we wound up talking.
Then we spent the entire 24 hours together. Finally, we started with a kiss and
ended up making long, passionate love.

But then, when I woke up in the middle of the night, my brain cooled down by the
darkness, I remembered a different world. And I remembered girl A. She was so
different from girl B that I could not imagine myself preferring one of them. I
realized I hurt girl A, and that made me really sad. But then I imagined leaving
girl B, and that made me even sadder.
