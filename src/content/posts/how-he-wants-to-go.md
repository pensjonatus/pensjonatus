Norman was hard sitting at his desk, going over the Henderson report and making
little notes on the margin. It was a complicated case, lots of things to watch
out for, and 2% of the quarter's profit margin relied on it. Heavily.

Norman loved his job so much he spent no less than 16 hours a day working. He
was at an age when sleep was not as important. In fact, he could hardly ever
fall asleep for more that two hours, so what else was there to do? He was proud
of his company. It was the child of over 60 years of work. More important than
his biological children or grandchildren.

That Henderson report was getting to him. He was finding it difficult to
concentrate. He thought about it for a moment and realized the source of his
distraction was a dull chest pain. No, not another heart attack, he thought.

But it was too late. He fell to the carpet. He knew he was dying.

There was so much work to do. There were so many things only he knew how to do.
He wished he had trained somebody who could take over. But then, would he have
retired years back? Would he have listened to his wife when she said he deserved
a rest? Would he have lived longer, until he became sick and dependent? Would he
have wished he could die, or would he have grasped for life with every little
bit of his willpower?

He rolled on his back, ignoring the debilitating pain and the black spots that
started filling the edges of his world. He focused on all the things that were
not finished and how much they mattered. He thought of the way he was as he was
dying, so strong and creative. How he had not taken a vacation in the last
thirty years. How he impressed others. And only one word resonated in his mind.

Finally.
