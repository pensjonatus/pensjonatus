I went out to see some live music, but everyone at the club had succumbed to
really bad bioresonance, so I caught it too.

"It's those Wallaces," my dad sad once over dinner, "They could never get
enough. Enough freedom, enough land, enough money. They brought bioresonance on
us. It's a curse. Metaphorically and literally."

So here at the club, I was mellowing in the thick soup of everyone else's
presence. Their mood became my mood, as it always does. There was a girl there
who, we were all afraid, could be in pain. She was pale and unbalanced.

"You dad," she said to me, "He blamed my ancestors."

"I know, I'm sorry. It was his opinion, not mine."

"What do you know about them, anyway?"

"Not much," I admitted.

"Do you know about Earth?"

"Just from school."

"But you don't really know," she was beginning to grimace, her pain was coming
to the surface, but I think unrelated to what she was saying. "You don't know
what they were running from and freed us all from. Do you know how bad things
got on earth?"

"Yeah," I said, "Poor people trying to eat the rich. And the government adding
taxes on top of taxes. I said I knew from school."

"Those were just the facts. But the world doesn't just contain facts. There are
also the truths and the un-truths. The things that are happening around and the
things that are happening inside us. Which do you think are more devastating?"

"I don't know. The ones outside, I guess. They can kill you."

"Yes," she nodded, "And the things outside, well, let's just say they don't talk
about those at any school. You have to come out and see."

"But you haven't seen," I pointed at her and everybody else pointed with me. The
bioresonance was getting worse.

"I have not," she admitted. "But my grandpa always talked to me about the
outside things he has seen. And he's not like those other people who lie."

I could not catch that last part because her pain melded into the bioresonance
and we all had a really bad time.
