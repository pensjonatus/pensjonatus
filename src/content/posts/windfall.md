Janice and I were over her laptop, waiting for the page to load. First the
banner, Bank TD North, then some blue frames, which finally filled with numbers.
Her account balance was eight figures long. She jumped up and gave a little
cowboy cheer, then toppled me and we fell to the floor together. She was kissing
my cheeks and neck. Then she sat on top of me, she had a huge smile on her face.

"I never have to go back into work again," she said.

I made myself laugh but I could not get happy. Ever since I heard she had won
the lottery I was just worried that now it would be completely stupid to break
up with her.

"Oh my God," she said, "I never knew this could happen. I mean, chances of
winning are astronomically low. Do you have any idea how many times I've
calculated the odds? But somebody always wins, and this time it's me."

She got up, looking outside the window.

"I need to get this garden in order. What am I saying? I'm going to get a new
house, somewhere nice, like Sausalito. It's got good weather, yeah. And my car?
It's history!"

I sat up.

"I know we've been over this already, but now the money is real. I mean, no more
credit for me. No need. I can have whatever I want. I can start writing again.
And paint."

She picked up the magazines from the coffee table, then put them back down. She
closed the lid of her laptop. She went over to fix the curtains. Then she
stopped and looked at me. She had sad eyes.

"Dan," she said, "I'm sorry it has to end like this," then her eyes changed,
"No, you know what? Actually, I am not. Pack your stuff, you're out of here
mister. Adios," she made a thumb gesture showing me the way to hell.

Two hours later I was walking towards Lisa's house. A bag of clothes over my
shoulder, a set of chiseled abs under my shirt, a new era was about to begin.
