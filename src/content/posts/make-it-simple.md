This is how I started biking to work. One morning I got into my car as usual,
but it wouldn't start. So I figured I would take it to the shop later, and I
took my bicycle. The way was so nice and refreshing, and it was good exercise,
so I decided to use the bicycle from then on.

But here's how I started walking to work. You see, one morning the chain on my
bike broke, so I just walked. It was still good exercise, and I could take the
time to enjoy the views.

But then I started working from home. Then quit my job. Then stopped going out
altogether. Do you know why? I found a trap door in my basement, that led to the
basement's basement. There, I was bit by a bug which made it so I don't need
sleep or food anymore.

Nah, I'm just kidding. I walk to work. I did get my car and my bike fixed, don't
worry about me.
