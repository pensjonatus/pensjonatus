The bus was full. Tom was sitting next to Anna and they were talking cheerfully
when the old lady got on.

"Excuse me, why don't you take my seat," he said.

"Thank you," said the lady, smiling, "That's very kind of you." And when she
took her seat she added "Must be my lucky day. First my grandson called and said
they were expecting, and now this. There are some good young people these days.
A lot are good, I bet."

Anna was now separated from Tom by the nice lady, but she did not get up to join
him in the aisle, so they had to stop talking. They exchanged smiles and silly
faces.

"Young man, why don't you put your bag next to my feet, I'll make room. It's
probably heavy," said the old lady.

"Nah, thanks. It's light enough. Besides, I work out so I can lift weights like
this. No problem."

"Well," said the old lady, "You should go easy on your back. If you ruin it now,
you will be sorry when you're my age."

"Thanks. I use my health why I have it. I doubt I'll be able to save it for
later."

Anna smiled over the lady's head. Tom smiled back and nodded.

His stop was coming up and there was silence until they reached it. Finally, Tom
said:

"Hey, Anna. I'll be getting off now. Remember to bring me the book tomorrow,
okay? I'll see you then. Bye." Then he turned to the lady, "Have a nice day,
ma'am."

"You too, young man, good bye."

He stepped off. As the bus was pulling away, he could see Anna's sad gaze for a
second and then she was gone. He hoped the world would not end and he could see
her the next day.
