The Skype signal madeÂ her snap out of a reverie. "Jason is calling..." popped
up. She clicked "Accept" and the video came on. Jason was smiling wide.

"Jason," she screamed in joy, "Oh my god, it's been so long."

"Hello, Melissa," he said. Were his eyes sad? She had known him since they were
children. They stayed in touch through college and afterwards a little, but then
things just dissipated. "I heard you were getting married."

"Yes," she raised the ring to the camera, "How did you hear?"

"My mother," he said, "She said it's Donald Brooks, the CEO of Marmalade
Connections."

"Have you heard of him?"

"Nah, I just remember the phrase she used in the email," he said. "Listen," he
paused, "Listen, congratulations, Melissa."

"Thank you," she said, "Will you come down for the wedding? It's June."

"Nah, I'm going to be traveling in June, I already checked. It's work. I have
to."

"I understand," she said.

"Melissa, do you remember when we were sitting by the abandoned motel? You know,
before college began? We were talking about being scientists, or engineers, or
Wall Street. We were kidding, but we also thought the world was ours. Yours and
mine."

She smiled, "I do remember. It's one of my fondest memories."

"Yours and mine, Melissa, that's what I thought."

There was silence.

"Anyway," he said, "I gotta go."

After he hung up, Melissa could no longer hear what he was saying, if he was
saying anything to his empty room. She minimized Skype and looked at the
pictures of women in wedding dresses. One of them looked just like her. Were her
eyes sad?
