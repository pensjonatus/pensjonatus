Through a one-way mirror, the doctor and the mother were looking into playroom
B, watching little Timmy play. The boy had just finished spelling the word
"REDRUM" with sticky blocks.

"I've said it before," said the doctor, "There is no such thing as demonic
possession. For centuries, primitive cultures attributed behavior they could not
understand to the supernatural. Women who practiced medicine in the Middle Ages
were burnt as witches. Ducks and geese were considered prophets. It was believed
that headaches are caused by Saint Damien. For goodness sake, we live in the age
of the Internet, Mrs. Thorn. There must be a perfectly logical explanation to
your son's erratic behavior."

"Well in that case," she said, "How do you explain this?"

The doctor looked back at the boy. The contents of playroom B were now floating
in the air, and as little Timmy (now three to four feet above the floor) was
consuming the soul of a stuffed hippo, the doctor realized he was going to have
to get his license, and his underwear, renewed.

Meanwhile, aboard the Illuminati mothership, Xlslorghon, the alien overlord who
was making all this happen, was having a moderately good time before his one
o'clock.
