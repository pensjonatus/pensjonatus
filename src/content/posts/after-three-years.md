I just found out my girlfriend has the annoying habit of eating raw parrot meat. It is making her sick and I can tell her hair is beginning to fall out. I put my paper away and said with concern:

"How can you do this? It is not only disgusting, it is also bad for you. Science has proven time and again..."

"I have always done it, ever since I was a tiny little girl. Parrot meat just seems so succulent. And it helps me wind down after a hard day. Besides, there is nothing I can do. I have tried."

I went back to reading my paper, irritated with myself. Why had I not taken the time to know this person over all these years? Do I lack the respect for her is it just me being an incorrigible dreamer again?
