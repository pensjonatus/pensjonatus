Kiss me, I'm Irish. Animal. Live free. FBI - Female Body Inspector. Doctor Who.
Nike, Adidas, and other company names. Be free. I know who _you_ are, but who am
_I_? All you need is love. All You Need Is Love. Freedom. Don't tread on me, and
a picture of a snake.

I cannot do anything without my COFFEE!!! By the way, coffee is a soft drug, in
my opinion, not as scary as heroin or some of the other stuff people put in
themselves, that is why it is legal. That part is not written on any shirts I
saw, it is just a comment from me.

Chaos. Kaos. Metallica. Chaos is freedom. Ms. Chaos. I am chaos. I M Chaos.
Horsetheband. Kovan Wake the Fuck Up.

Nintendo. Nerd 4 Life. Cannabis. Ronaldo. Caterpillar. Those Who Brave, San
Francisco Beach Squad Forever. Ironic. \*.jpg. She left me... my guitar. Beans,
beans, magical fruit, the more you eat them the more you... vote for Obama.
Freedom or death. Give me freedom of give me death. It's better to die standing
up than to live on your knees - Emiliano Zapata. Che Guevara. Zen.

Poisonous. Seductive. Tasty. Pornstar. Playboy. Music. Your babe. Yes. No.
Maybe. My other shirt is a suit of armor. Women's rights now. Frankie say relax.
I went to Alamo and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

Crocodile. Come closer. Stop staring. My eyes are up here. What are you looking
at. Thug. Tough. Cough. USMC. United States Marine Corp. U.S. Postal Service.
Applecore. Johnny Appleseed. American Apparel.

$. $$$. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. God.
