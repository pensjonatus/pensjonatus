When I was little, I used to think the deathbed was a special place they moved
you to when they knew you were about to die. I thought the sheets were black and
there were skulls on the posts. What do you think it would look like?

When my father was dying, he had the disinterested look of a junkie. He did not
care I was in the room, all he could see was his dying moment. It made me feel
angry, because I flew all the way back to the Old Country to see him out of this
world, but he barely noticed my presence. He acknowledged me like you
acknowledge a person taking the seat next to you on the bus. Just a quick
glance, a courtesy, from one city dweller to another. Seemed out of place in the
stinky old hovel.

When he was done, I put on my hat, ready to leave. His young wife was crying,
drowning in her moment. Barely noticed me getting up.
