It was a slow day in non-fiction writing class. The professor had prepared a
storyÂ about a sax player, but nobody was getting into it because the examples
only showed what they had already learnt. The professor sensed something was not
working, but he did not know how to fix it. Or did not care. Either way, Tracy
was so bored, she decided to change the pace a little.

"Professor, do you remember Trent Hauser?" she had been thinking about bringing
up the subject before but she never did, not until this day. Even as she spoke,
her throat went dry and the last word of the sentence turned out squeaky. It was
as if she sensed this was not a good idea.

"Yes," said the professor without looking at her, "He was a student here. What
about him?"

"Have you read any of his flash fiction?"

"I might have, one time in class. Why?"

"I've been reading his blog," she said, "And I quite like it. It reminds me of
your style."

"What of it?"

"He was recently published in _The New Yorker,_" she said

"Miss Baxter, do you have a point?"

"No, professor. Sorry."

"Good," he said, "Now can we get back to work, please?"
