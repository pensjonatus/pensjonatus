Valentine got lots of birthday cards, and they were all on the table, basking in
the afternoon sun. Valentine was basking in the warm wishes he got.

Currently, over a cup of tea, he was reading the cards one by one. Some were
plain and simple, and contained only the acknowledgment of Valentine's birthday.
Others went into wishes of a great day, great year, or great life. Some
contained factory-reprinted poems, while other contained original poems.

But the ones he liked the most, the ones he put aside onto a separate pile, were
from Valentine's many children. He read and re-read each one, cherishing every
word.

In those cards, the children wrote:

"I am sorry I spent so much time away from you. I will be better now."

"I really appreciate and I am thankful for your advice."

"I am glad you care so much. Care so much it sometimes hurts."

"You are so important because without you I would not exist."

"You were right all along."

"I don't need my space."

"I don't think my life would be better without you!"

Valentine took a sip of tea and smiled, smiled, smiled. He put all of his hands
on the special pile. It was warm.
