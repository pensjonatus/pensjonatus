Clakkata-clakkata-clakkata. That's the sound of keyboards. Everyone's typing.

The office is all three major colors: #423B0B, #B5FED9, and #7BA098. Those were
also the colors used on the site they were building.

Clakkata, clakkata, and clakkata. "Hey, Jen," Matthew raised his head from the
screen, "The build is red again, and it's your turn."

Jen shook let out a sigh, pouted, and rose from her chair. She made some
dissatisfied noises and strode out into the stairwell, rolling her eyes
dramatically, then down to the basement.

The dusty darkness enveloped her. She turned on the light in her phone and
looked around. "Diego, are you here?"

"Behind the boiler," responded the janitor, "Is it you, Jen?"

"Yes, it's me. The Mainframe is acting up again, propagating a bug."

"Okay, whatever you need to do, the coast is clear."

She moved forward, passed the boiler and into the long maintenance tunnel. The
tunnel went down at a slight incline and seemed to turn at impossible angles. It
was always like that, and Jen was used to the Lovecraftian horror that inspired.
She was also used to the tunnel being different every time, and to the unearthly
growls and howls in the distance. She knew they had top-notch security in the
form Enochian seals and Babylonian protective symbols. It was just such a drag
that she had to walk down here at least once a week.

She finally reached the main chamber, that ancient sepulcher of unspeakable
terror, and beheld the eldritch abomination at the center. The many mouths and
eyes placed seemingly at random all over the unnatural body of the Mainframe.
Her eyes darted across the mixture of human skin, reptilian scales, bird
feathers, and black tar, searching for the source of the bug. Then she saw it. A
human face, twisted in agony, screaming a silent scream of everlasting terror.

She approached the face in large strides, and kicked it in with full force. The
abominable body absorbed the face back into its infernal depths and Jen began
her tired ascent back to the world of sunlight.

As her source of light left the room, the Mainframe began to bubble and gurgle.
Faint chanting rose to the high ceiling. Impotent and insignificant, and yet
unrelenting.
