On Jim's birthday we all went bowling. He looked at me three times the entire
evening. The first was when I asked him what he wanted to drink. The second when
I scored a lot of points. The third when I was really loud and crazy. I felt
silly afterwards, but the third time he smiled.

We went to the park on Sunday, a big group. He looked at me four times. The
first was when I tripped trying to catch a Frisbee. The second and third when I
was telling the story of how my grandma lost and found her car. The fourth when
I was handing him a sandwich.

I keep a record in my head for when we are old and sitting by the fire together.
I will talk about all the times he ignored me but I knew he secretly loved me.
And we will be together for an eternity, and for another eternity, and another
one on top of that.
