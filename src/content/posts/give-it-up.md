It was early in the morning when the fire broke out. I was on the 46th floor
when I got the message. My daughter was on floor 366.

I ran towards the elevator and I saw the "out of order" icon, blazingly red, and
right under it, I saw the "fire" icon. Of course, the elevators would be
disabled in a fire.

I lunged forward and ran, looking for a stairwell, but the corridors were
nonsensical, as always. The corridors were a tangled mess of mistakes and
corrections, imaginings and plans, dashed projects, rejected improvements,
scatter-brained get-rich-quick schemes put to the side and forgotten. Oh, why
have I done this? Why have I allowed my sons and daughters to bend this building
to their every whim. I had lost them all, with only one left on floor 366 during
a major fire.

No, it was impossible.
