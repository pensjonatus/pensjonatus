They were kissing and he could tell she was getting hot and wet. Or at least he
was hoping she was, because he was ready to tear all her clothes off. But she
whispered "No, I'm not that kind of girl. Please, let's not do anything tonight.
Okay? I'm sorry."

He learned to accept it over the next few weeks. Until one night, they were
about to go out, she was getting ready, and he was sitting at her desk, just
waiting. He picked up a book. It was _Naked Lunch_. He read a few paragraphs and
thought he has to read the whole thing one day because it is awesome. Then he
opened her laptop.

He was a cunning computer operator, so he ran a search on all videos, including
hidden files, and found something that looked promising. He turned the volume
down to make sure she does not hear.

It was porn. Amateur, the picture was grainy, the shot was constant, like the
cam was on a bedpost. A girl in a blonde wig being fucked doggy style. He
smiled, so everybody watches this kind of stuff. But then he realized it was
her. It was the girl who was taking a shower across the hall.

There were a few dozen videos like that in the search results. Suddenly, he
realized he was not handsome, not very good in bed (not that she would know!),
and not particularly desirable in general. For a dark dark minute, he felt like
his life was completely over.
