I bought a doll from an antique shop on Upper East Side. It had a white china
face and beautiful silk clothes. It was centuries old, but extremely well
preserved. I brought it home to Victoria.

"Thank you," she said with a broad smile, "You're so sweet. You always know what
to get me. Where do you find such beautiful things?"

"I have an eye for beauty," I said and she kissed me long and warm, and then
loosened my tie, one of her many ways to initiate love.

When we lay awake later, staring into the skylight, she said: "The doll will
keep me company when you are away. It will inspire me, and when I cannot write,
it will comfort me. We will wait for you together."

"It belonged," I said, "To a French merchant's daughter in the eighteenth
century. He brought it for her from Switzerland. She was the first in his family
to be born into luxury, you know. He was a self-made man."

"Just like you," she said.

Later on, when I knew the apartment would no longer bear witness to our love, I
saw the doll on the shelf where she had left it. Long forgotten, part of an
array of her possessions. Tokens of my devotion.
