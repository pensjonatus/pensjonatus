Seth was out with his friends again. He came straight from the gym, so he was
still pumped up and high on endorphin. He felt like a tiger strolling among
donkeys, all his wiry muscles hard as steel, his skin tight, his veins clearly
visible. His muscle-fit shirt was almost bursting from his muscles. Muscles,
muscles, muscles.

The ladies seemed to notice, at least that is what he thought. He held his head
up high and demonstrated the peak of his wit to all around. He was also
chivalrous, offering his seat to Lisa, bringing drinks for the table, and
keeping up conversation with complete disregard of his male dominance.

"I agree with Bethany," he said, "Women are objectified and it needs to stop.
And those images just create an unhealthy fascination with the flesh."

Towards the end of the night, a group of younger guys was being noisy and
disturbing everyone. Seth sat up straight and demonstrated openness to conflict,
but the men did not pay attention. He threw a few disappointed looks in their
general direction, but they still did not seem to notice. They left without a
brawl.

Finally, at the end of the night he projected his earthly lust onto Melody,
using thoughts and postures of course, not words or looks. He pictured grabbing
her breasts in a flux of desire, and could almost hear her moans, but she did
not seem to notice. Everybody went their own separate ways.

Seth was walking home, nay, prowling the streets at night, but his high spirits
began to wane. Nobody appreciated his raw animal strength. Nobody noticed he was
a true barbarian.
