I was on the phone, so I was able to take control of the project. Lucky! I think
it can be finished within the next seven days, two days before the deadline. At
any rate, it's good I was there, if I say so myself.

I don't know how it happened. How can I be a stock broker and risk manager after
all the chemistry my mind has absorbed? They say neurons never regenerate, but
that can't be true. Look at how crystal clear everything is. I can plan, I can
organize, I can win at business. Last year, I made the company a big round
twenty million dollars.

Sometimes I think it's all a high. I am lying in a puddle of piss somewhere,
imagining the good life and I can no longer tell what is real and what is not. I
look into your calm eyes and I think it's too good to be true. I look into your
happy eyes and I think it's to good to be true.
