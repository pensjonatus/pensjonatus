Tamara put on the black tank top with the Jack Daniel's logo and stood in front
of a mirror. It was tight. Maybe too tight?

She stood sideways. What the hell? She had been dieting and working out like
crazy, but her belly was still round. She inspected her arms and legs, they were
skinny, practically no fat, her face was alright too. So what the hell?

She put on a hoodie, zipped it up and left.

The closet door opened slightly and two gnomes stumbled out.

"She be gone now, won't be back for a good amount of time," said Nibbletrick.

"Aye, my friend," said Barfinkle, "Let's just hope the Orb of Destiny is safe
with her."

"Fear not, noble Barfinkle, she is under protection of the one named Chad, son
of Stan. They will be watching the moving pictures at the horseless carriage
theater and then probably eat iced cream at the apothecary."

"Let us be hopeful nobody rips her belly open," said Barfinkle with a challenge
in his voice, "Because then all will be for naught."

"Ah, but around here," said Nibbletrick, "Hardly anyone gets their belly ripped
open. 'Tis a peaceful place."

Barfinkle nodded and then smiled a cunning smile. "When the buyer arrives, we
are going to be rich, my friend."

The thought of mountains of gold made the gnomes joyful. They grabbed each
other's hands and danced a little jig together, singing and whooping.
