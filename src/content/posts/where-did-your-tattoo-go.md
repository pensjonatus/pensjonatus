The guys were drinking some beers, relaxing after work. There were five of them at the table. Jim said:

"Hey Mike, I was wondering. You're gay, right?"

"Yeah," said Mike without losing his confidence, "Everybody knows that. You were wondering about that?"

"No , I was wondering about something else. You used to have a wife, right? Were you gay back then?"

"Yes, I was."

"So how did you...? I mean, did you sleep with her?"

"Yes I did."

"And what was it like for you?"

"I could never come. She was great and all, very caring, and I could get it up and make her come, but I could never come."

"So what did she say?"

"I told her it was because of the condom. I told her it numbs me so much I can't feel her. She always finished me with her hand or her mouth while I thought of guys."

"Did she know...? Did she know you were gay?"

"I don't know," said Mike, and then he leaned back in his chair. "One night, after she was done, she got up to get into the shower and I said 'Hey, where did your tattoo go?' except she never had a tattoo and I knew it. I don't know why I said it."

The guys did not say anything to that, they kept quiet until Sal said "Let me get the next round."
