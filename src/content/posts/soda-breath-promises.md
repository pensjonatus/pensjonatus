Their eyes first met when they were at a burger place with their respective
groups of friends. He noticed her because she looked at him too long. From that
moment, he could not help but keep looking at her too long as well until the
night was over.

The second time they saw each other was on the subway, almost two years later.
She smiled and he thought he knew her very well but could not remember where
they met, so he wanted to walk up and talk to her, but the train stopped and she
left.

Finally, they met at a big party, being just two people out of two hundred. When
he saw her in the crowd, he realized he missed her dark eyes which he seemed to
know so well. He moved towards her arduously, and she stood there, waiting,
looking frightened.

He tried to say hi, but the music was too loud for anyone to hear anything so he
would have given up, but she took his hand and led him outside.

"Hi," he said in the cool of night. "I don't know you, but I missed you."

She nodded and then smiled. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, so
he kissed her. Her breath smelled like Dr Pepper's cream soda and her lips were
very soft. He moved back to look at her again and smiled.

But she shook her head, turned around, and walked away.
