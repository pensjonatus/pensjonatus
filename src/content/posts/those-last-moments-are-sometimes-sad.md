Olivia was dying. She was in a haze, stretched mercilessly between pain and pain
medication. She could not tell for sure what was real and what was not, but she
assumed meadows, houses, offices, and lakes were not real. She assumed the
hospital room was real.

Her father could not have been real, he had died years before. He was leaning
over and saying: "You've done all you could. Made it as far as any human can.
You did not take the easy way out. You stuck it out. I'm proud of you, girl. I
will see you soon." And so on. But she did not believe in an afterlife.

Another surge of pain. Another surge of weakness.

Alan was sitting there. He had something in his lap. Was it their daughter? How
old was she now? Olivia could not remember. She saw her as a baby, she also saw
her groing up and growing old. But maybe that was just dreams. Olivia thought
her duaghter was probably nine. Yes, she remembered the birthday, watched it
from a wheelchair. Nine.

Alan was sitting with a stuffed monkey in his lap. He probably left their
daughter with his sister. It was likely he was really here. She was pretty sure
he was real.

He was crying. "Olivia, honey. Please, please, don't leave me. What about your
daughter?"

"Alan," Olivia gasped, "Please. I am so tired."

The last word most likely never left her mouth. She was dead before the machine
realized and started the alarm. She was dead before she could ask him to let her
go.
