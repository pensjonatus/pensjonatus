"Can't you go to him?"

"He's got a wife and kids."

"I don't care. Stay with a friend."

"Max," she said, "I have nowhere to go. Don't you get it?"

whore."

"Is this what I am to you now? A whore? After two years of marriage? You can

"Because you slept with another guy. I would never do this to you. And you? You

"What did you do with him?" he asked.

"We left the party and got a hotel room. I sucked his cock. We took a shower
