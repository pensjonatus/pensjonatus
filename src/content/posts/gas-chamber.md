This new club is really popular with the youth. It is preferred to places like
the The Guillotine and The Drowning Place because it offers slow agonizing
death. It is called The Gas Chamber and you can meet quietusÂ in a way that is
reminiscent of some of the most primitive ages in human history.

The gases used vary from day to day, but most of the time death comes after no
less than 10 minutes of inhalation. It is often accompanied by tears, a metallic
taste, aching joints, difficulty breathing, vomiting, headaches, loss of vision,
loss of hearing, loss of muscle control including soiling yourself, convulsions
and hallucinations.

Two of my children and one cousin have already died there, and my sister went to
watch a few times. It is cheaper to just watch.
