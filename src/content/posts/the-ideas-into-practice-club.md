Classes were over, the teachers had gone to their own wing, leaving the boys to
spend free time as they pleased. In the seniors' dorm, a group
of mysterious characters convened. It was getting dark outside as Mark began the
proceedings. "I would like to call to order the 29th weekly meeting of the Ideas
Put Into Practice Club. Attendance," he looked around, "Everybody's present.
Let's begin. Jonah, what did you do this week."

"Well, my idea was to start a pizza club. So, I called on a few friends and we
had a pizza dinner together."

"Very nice," Mark nodded with approval, "A little less raunchy than your last
week's idea, but I will accept it. Next up is Sam."

"I was walking down St. James Road..."

"Sam, the short version, please."

"My idea was to put riddles into books at the library that would lead to more
riddles and so on. The prize is the key to my father's wine cellar and
instructions on how to get in and out unnoticed."

"And what of?" asked mark, raising a brow.

"My father is missing eight very old, very expensive bottles."

Everybody giggled. "Very good, Sam. I see we made no mistake accepting you, you
are living up to the standard. Now, Jerry."

"Oh, Mark, my dear son, you will never believe," Jerry sang.

"Let's hear it, old boy."

"I decided it would be really great to have some girls around here, so..." a
sudden loud grunt interrupted. They all looked towards the scullery door, where
it came from, and then turned to Eric, a boy who did not have a chance to speak
yet.

"Eric," Mark asked politely, "What is that?"

"A bear," the boy said with an innocent smile. A wild roar shook the room.
