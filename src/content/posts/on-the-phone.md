John stirred in the dark. Right after his sudden awakening, came the sound of
his phone vibrating. He picked up quickly.

"Hello?"

"John, is it you? It's Lisa."

"Lisa?"

"I wanted to tell you something. I- You can come home, John. I'm not mad
anymore."

The girl next to John gave a displeased moan. "Who is it? It's probably two
a.m."

John wished she had not spoken. He hoped Lisa did not hear.

"Is there someone there? With you?"

"It's-" He did not finish, Lisa hung up.

He put the phone away and lay down. The girl next to him started breathing
slowly. John waited for the phone to vibrate again. Eventually, he slept.
