Day 7778:

A bird perched on the window. Made me look outside, onto the restless sea
crashing its waves against the cold shore of my former motherland. Former, I
say, because I cannot agree to love a mother who damned me to this fate. I
wanted to murder the bird, the sea, the sky, the wind... One cannot do things
like that.

Day 7779:

In my mind, I replayed brutal scenes from my previous life. I was not a hero,
but a mericless brute. I spent most of my day in this fashion.

Day 7780:

My imprisonment has affected my mind, I can no longer recall her face, or her
name, or where we met, or how we lived, or how we loved. I am not even certain
there ever was a she. I long for a conversation, my guards are all mutes. Or
might as well be.

Day 7781:

It is all my fault, because I never cherished what I had. In my previous life, I
always looked forward into the future, always chasing, never enjoying the catch.
Eating a piece of cake, I thought of another. Reading a wonderful poem, I
thought of another. Standing in the presence of a sweet landscape, I thought of
another. Caressing a woman, I thought of another. Sadly, now I feel the gravity
of every moment I spend here. I had never lived before this.

Day 7782:

The cheese I ate today was especially pungent.
