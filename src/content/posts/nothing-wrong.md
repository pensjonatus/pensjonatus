It is going to be a cold night on deck, boatswain. I know you are not in
rotation for night watch, but you could come up and keep me company. I thought
of it when I saw you in the mess. You were eating your salad with your fingers
and I thought you are a man of adventure, a man of the sea. I am sure you could
tell me a lot of great stories and time would pass by faster.

There is nothing wrong with two men talking, boatswain. Nothing wrong at all,
even though people now think of it as dirty. There is nothing like the bond that
is created between two seamen in line of duty.

I would be honored if you could join me tonight. We would smoke cigarettes and
look at the sea. She is so big and powerful and we are so small. It does not
matter what we do. Not in the grand scheme of things.
