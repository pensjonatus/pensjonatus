After the art show, we walked six blocks to her apartment. At the end of the
journey, she said "Do you want to come in?"

My heart was pounding all the way up the stairs. Our eyes met as she was looking
for the keys, she smiled nervously. We shut the door behind us already kissing.

I started unbuttoning her blouse, but she stopped me. She took a step back and
finished unbuttoning slowly, looking at me all the time. Then she lay on the
floor, face down.

"Will you step on me?" she said. And when I hesitated, she added "Please, I'll
do whatever you want."

I took a step towards her.

"Don't take your shoes off," she said.

"Okay," I put one foot on her back.

"Harder."

I was careful.

"Your other foot, please."

I put my other foot on her ass, expecting to feel bones cracking, but the human
body is a tough thing to break. She began to tremble and breathe hard. She was
almost there.
