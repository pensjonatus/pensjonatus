The sound of someone banging on my door awoke me from fitful sleep. It was the
middle of the night. I scrambled out of bed and walked down the hall. My door
did not have a peephole so I could not see who it was. I reached for the lock
but hesitated. Somebody banged again. I retreated into the kitchen, tried to
ignore the banging.

The banging came back a few hours later, around breakfast time. I was sitting on
the couch with a book, trying to make myself sleepy. The banging was more
insistent this time. More aggressive. I walked up to the door. Listened. More
banging. I went back to the couch.

The third time was in the evening. It was dark outside, peaceful. The banging
was calmer too. Inviting. It almost fooled me. I did not open. You cannot fool
me with your soft knocks. You will go away eventually. I know you will.
