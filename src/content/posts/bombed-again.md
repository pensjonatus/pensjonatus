The music died suddenly. The dancing figures stopped in mid motion, an arm
cranked here, a head full of curls bobbed there, but overall they turned into a
sculpture. They were waiting for the rhythm to resume.

The DJ was not happy with the song. He was just not feeling it, not getting into
it. He let them hang there for three seconds before he started from a different
angle. The beats filled the air.

He was holding the headphones in one hand, adjusting the knobs and buttons with
the other. He was looking over the waving crowd, looking for that red-haired
girl who used to stand by the wall before she realized she was a woman.
Suddenly, the light show turned everything blue.
