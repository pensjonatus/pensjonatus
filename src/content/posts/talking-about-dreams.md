When she felt more confident with me, she started talking about her dreams.

"They're really weird sometimes," she said, "Like this one time I was in this
old elementary school they turned into a hospital and then deserted after some
kind of war. Only local people were using it again and I ended up in this room
where they have rows of cots with babies in them. I spent some time with the
babies until I realized they were not babies at all but something different."

I nodded, signalling I was a good listener and also understood the emotions she
was feeling. I stopped myself from retelling a dream I had because she did not
want to hear that, she just wanted to talk. Keeping silent, I was scoring
points.

"One time," she continued, "I had a baby myself, only it turned out not to be a
good baby at all and I hated it. So I left it at a bus stop."

"Wait," I said, "Are we still talking about dreams?"
