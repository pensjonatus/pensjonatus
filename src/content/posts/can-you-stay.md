"Can you stay?" she said.

"I can't. Promised my wife I'd be home for dinner."

"It's eleven pm," she said, "You are late for dinner."

like to go?"

"Not sure," she said.

He sat on the bed. She started running her hand up and down his back.

"Why do you want to spend more time with me?" he asked, "Isn't this enough?"

She stopped. "Not sure," she said, "I just do. Weren't you leaving?"

"Yeah," he said, "I need to get going."
