I calculated that I wash my hands, on average, seven times a day. That is why I
have seven paper towels in my bathroom. I use one each time I wash my hands and
then I hang it up to dry. By the time I start a new seven the next morning, all
seven are dry again.

But my friend knows a better trick. He is a famous writer who has chosen to
mentor bloggers anonymously. He posts comments on their blogs using the Socratic
method (no answers, only questions) and coaxes greatness out of them. What is in
it for him? He gets wonderful writing online without paying for books.

But that is nothing still. My aunt invented a way to generate free electricity
from the tree in her backyard. She will not reveal her secret to me, but the
fact of the matter is: she has jumper cables plugged into the tree, the cables
go into a black box and then another set of cables go from the black box to her
main power line. Her power bills are always zero. I've seen a full drawer of
zero-value bills in her kitchen going back twelve years.

Better yet, a guy I know posted his phone number encrypted into a story online.
Give him a call to gain life eternal, the best lifehack of all.
