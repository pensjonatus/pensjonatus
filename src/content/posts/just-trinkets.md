After my uncle died, I inherited a lot of small things. In life, he was not so
much a hoarder, as a sentimental man, so he kept ticket stubs, buttons, dried
flowers in envelopes, broken chains, keys whose locks have long been ripped out
and replaced, small notes and memos, and so on.

I left the lawyer's office with 14 cardboard boxes of these tiny treasures. When
I unloaded them in the garage, they covered the whole workbench, which by the
way, I never used. I opened the first box and started looking through the
things. An invitation to a Halloween party in 1971. A belt buckle. A plastic
beetle.

My wife appeared in the door leading to the house. She looked tired. She did not
ask if there was any money, she did not make fun of my workbench finally being
useful, she did not complain or anything. She was not there. The lights were on,
but the house was empty, poor thing. I knew depression was swooping in to take
her again. I did not know if it was for good this time.

She was holding a yellow post-it.

"What you got there?" I asked.

She looked at it slowly, then at me. "I wrote down a phone number, I was on my
way to throw this out. I don't need it anymore."

"Can I have it?" I said.
