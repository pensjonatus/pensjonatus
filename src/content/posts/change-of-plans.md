Not so sure you were pretty, not sure you were ugly either. You had a woolen hat on, your mascara was flowing down your cheeks. Was it the rain, or had you been crying? No matter, I did not need to know. I was already sure you were the one. Came into my life so unexpectedly, carried a certain heat with you, a change in temperature. Made me no longer feel so cold anymore.

I followed you from the party to the train station. You were so alone, and so fucked up. You did not even realize no train was coming, it was almost 4 am. It was alcohol and drugs and loneliness, you had not realized all you needed in life was me. And here I was.

You tried to deny what you felt, but I knew better. I weighed you down to the ground. You were so passionate, you scratched my face. I did not care. Love was in the air.

I left you sleepy, satisfied, hardly breathing. A complacent little ball of comfort and hurt. That sweet hurt that comes from when a world is torn apart to show you the light of a new, brighter one. Sweet disillusionment.

I am sorry I met you on the day I decided to die. Perhaps I will not do it after all. Perhaps I have something to live for. Perhaps that something is you.
