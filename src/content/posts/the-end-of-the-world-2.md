It is the end of the world, but there is no fire in the sky or people screaming. There is almost no fire anywhere and everyone is already dead or slowly dying.

I spend my time in the ruins of an ancient city. I walk among the shattered glass from the enormous skyscrapers, it would be a hazard if there were any children around. They would cut their tiny feet as they laughed and played. But the world has not seen children for so long.

I stop to admire the giant overpass, a stretch of highway above the historical district. Down below, people would stroll and stop for coffee, or chat with friends. High above machines would move in a hurry, not a bolt out of place, all perfectly planned. I wonder why they built this giant road and then I think about practical reasons - getting supplies into the city from all around. Practical things no longer apply. A million million apartments with chairs nobody will ever sit on and windows nobody will look out of.

There are creatures left here and there, hardly human anymore. I am hardly human myself. No more need for shelter from the rain. No more hunger to satisfy. No words I could use to speak to the others. No desire get anything across.

The night falls. The sky is overcast and I cannot see the stars. It is a pity. I could see a lot now that all the lights are out.
