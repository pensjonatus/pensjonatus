We were sitting at a diner, eating burgers. I had decided that would be the best
way to celebrate my new citizenship, so American.

"Look outside," said Rob, "Are these elephants? Elephants in the middle of the
street?"

"Circus in town?" I asked. "Look, they are helping people from the sidewalk get
on the elephant's back."

"That's no circus," said Clem, "I read about this. They're elephanteers. People
riding elephants for health and sanity."

"Huh?" Marsha articulated interest. A rare sight.

"Think about it," said Clem, "Elephants have been with humans since the dawn of
time. Mammoths at first, actually. They were there when the greatest empires
existed. They influenced the social order. Some people discovered that and they
pushed Congress to allow regular folks to have elephants."

"So," said Rob, "What are the benefits?"

"Riding an elephant, being near an elephant, and seeing one is very soothing for
the mind. Especially riding one, it's like, the most natural form of massage. It
makes you calm and focused. A study showed it increases your IQ. Plus it removes
bad electrons. Something about elephant skin that does that."

"Sounds fucking stupid to me," said Marsha, and then just sat there with her
lower jaw forward, looking really tough.
