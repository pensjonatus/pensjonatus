When I found myself cast away on Hispaniola, I did not trek to any of the cities
right away, but I roamed the uninhabited areas for a while until I discovered a
small cave behind a waterfall. The cave was only big enough to crawl into and
lie down. The water let some light in, so it was not completely black, but dimly
lit during daytime. There were no mosquitoes inside. I found the place very
soothing, so I decided to spend a few days before I move on.

As I lay there, I gave some thought to my past. My weakling days back in the Old
Country and my first steps as a sailor. Then my more adventurous days as a
pirate, and finally, my disagreement with the captain, which led to my present
solitude. All things considered, I felt accomplished, and gradually my mind
shifted away from the past and focused on the future.

In the meantime, I sometimes left my cave to catch some fish and eat some
berries that I foraged nearby.

My thoughts of the future were mostly dreams of glory. I imagined myself a
captain of my own ship, famous and feared, but most of all, rich. Finally, I
imagined myself on an island as the governor of a vast estate.

Tired of future dreams, I started exploring the present and found myself
dreaming of a woman. The months at sea were lonely and male companionship,
though stimulating on hot Caribbean nights, is not the same as the touch of fair
female skin. I pictured myself with the wench I love, caressing her and talking
of our future together.

However, before long I realized her presence would poison the perfect balance of
my solitary cave behind the waterfall. So I stopped imagining, and just looked
at the shimmering water. I became lost in the perfect harmony.
