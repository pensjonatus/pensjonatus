"Another one, please," and the waitress shuffled away to get me another
candy-flavored drink.

"Three with lunch is enough," said Monica, but that was a joke.

"Right you are, my love," I joked back. We were not a couple, never would be.

"Now you're just talking crazy," Bo did not get the joke, and tried to make one
of his own. Inferior.

"But why _do_ you want another one?" asked Monica, stressing the word do.

"I'm not sure. Maybe I'm thirsty. Maybe I like the taste. It's like bubblegum."

"Or maybe it's the liquor, am I right?" said Bo. "Do anything to get smashed, am
I right?"

"Maybe it's the urgency of having money," I said. "Subconsciously, I want to
spend it all before I die. And the more I spend on liquor, the faster I'm going
to die."

"And on drugs," said Monica. Made me think of a motel room we once shared. There
was no sex, but a lot of drugs, and ineptly taken. She was so young back then.
Now she removed her enormous sunglasses and looked at me with her deep brown
eyes. Circles around the eyes. Wrinkles. So beautiful.

I raised my glass, "Here's to drugs."
