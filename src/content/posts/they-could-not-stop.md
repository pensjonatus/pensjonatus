My boss told me that when he was on a business trip, his wife would call about
once an hour just to make sure he was okay. He laughed when he said it and I
knew he did not like it. He told me she called late at night when he was in bed
with Jane. They both stopped so he could talk and Jane was so cute when she
tried to calm her breathing down while he talked, her mouth was open. And then
he told me how Jane could not take the wait anymore and started to move her hips
a little bit, making him slide in and out a little bit. They both came like they
never had before.

I think my boss sometimes tells exaggerated stories.
