Mr. Black's wrinkled fingers put the two tiny elements together. He was squeezing the tiny metal ball, waiting for the glue to set a little. He raised his eyes at me and pouted.

"What's on your mind, Mr. Black?" I asked.

"I was just wondering whether you were bored."

"Oh, no. Not at all. I'm waiting to see what you create today."

"Ah," he said, "It's going to be really special. I think you will enjoy it."

I looked out the window, the sky was overcast. The ancient city of Prague was retiring from a busy Monday, slowly going to sleep. The night shift of party-goers and bandits would take over soon. I moved in my harness, the arm-pit strap was a little uncomfortable.

"Are you all right in there?" he asked.

"Yes, Mr. Black. I was just..."

"Now," he said calmly, "You know you should not move. Good boys do not move."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Black."

"Do you know what you would be doing if you were not here?"

"I know Mr. Black."

"You would be at work all day and then alone at home at night. Would you like that?"

"No, Mr. Black. Not that much."

"Good," said Mr. Black, "So I would appreciate if you could stop twitching and be a good boy for a change."

"Yes, Mr. Black," I said, trying as hard as I could not to smile.

"Now," he said, looking at the metal elements on the table, "Just a little more and I can start applying. Are you ready?"

"Oh yes, Mr. Black."
