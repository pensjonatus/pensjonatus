"He is not a burglar _per se_," I said, "I mean, he did break in, but he did not
steal anything. He just sort of... moved in."

"What does your wife think about it?"

"She was livid at first, but now I think she's learned to deal with it. She
offers him to join us at meals, but he politely refuses."

"Does he eat out?"

"No, he has his own food. It's always neatly labeled. With different names,
though, so I think it might be stolen. I would hate it if the police raided our
house because of it. But anyway, we just need to remember not to eat the things
that are labeled. Those are his."

"What about the kids?"

"Toby likes him. They sometimes play catch in the backyard. I don't like his
friends so much, but he keeps them separate from Toby."

"What about your daughter?"

"I think she is sort of dating him. Or maybe they're not exclusive, but there is
some chemistry. Well, it's complicated at this point."

"So what are you going to do?"

I hefted up the empty plastic barrel, put it at the back of my truck. There were
four more waiting in the garage. "I gotta haul these out," I said. Birds were
singing in the trees, the sun was shining, chasing away the morning cool. Spring
was beginning.
