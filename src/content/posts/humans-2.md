I woke up as usual and sniffed around the apartment to make sure everything was
the way I left it. Then I played with Jimmy the Sock until My Love woke up.
Little did I know, this day was going to be different than most days.

My Love filled my bowl and I ate ravenously. I love her so much because she
gives me food. Oh, glorious food! One has to be a wonderful creature to have
access to all this food and share it willingly. In return, I have nothing to
give her but my love, and I give it willingly too.

After breakfast and some roughhousing, My Love gave us the signal to leave. A
walk! I love these as well. So many smells, sights, and sounds. Our world is a
wonderful place.

I emerged on the other end of the walk, got over the frenzy of sensations, and
realized this walk had taken us to parts unknown. Normally, the walk ended back
home. This time, we were in a large, well-lighted indoor space with other humans
either sitting at their computers, or milling about, doing human things. My Love
greeted the other humans, so I assumed they were allies and gave them kind
acknowledgement. Some of them presented their hands (though with no treats!) and
pet me. I memorized their smells, as I always do.

My love found me a spot under a desk and I lounged there. There was some
exploring to do after I got settled in, but for now, the spot gave me respite,
and a good vantage point. Later this would be one of my my regular spots during
what I came to call Our Days at the Office.
