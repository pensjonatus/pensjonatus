## Monday

The detectives were all called into the briefing room for a special announcement
from the captain. Apparently, they were all being assigned to the same case:
people around town were found with their skulls open, brains scooped out. It was
exciting and scary. Everybody knew somebody, even a friend of a friend, who was
killed in this way. Casualties reached 9% of the city's population and more
cases kept being reported.

## Wednesday

Detective Krug was on the case, he was examining leads, but he was not finding
anything. His youth's ambition was giving him a hard time. He was on his way
home when he saw his neighbor on the sidewalk. The neighbor's skull had been
neatly opened. The brain was missing.

## Friday

Detective Matheson thought she had found an eye witness, but when she reached
him, he had already been de-brained.

## Sunday

Detective Krug and detective Matheson witnessed a de-braining. A tiny but deadly
blade burst out of a person's skull and cut around to remove the scalp. Then,
the wielder of the blade appeared. It was the brain itself!

It popped out of the person's skull and crawled away to safety.

"What do you think about that?" asked detective Krug, all shook up.

"Welp, looks like we have our perp," said detective Matheson, lighting a
cigarette. "It's a real shame we cannot slap a pair of cuffs on him."

"Why are the brains leaving the skulls, though?" he asked. "Is it because we are
trapped in the solipsism of social media? Are we slaves to our bodies and our
technology? Are selfies and pop music driving brains out of humanity? Is that
why they crawl out?"

Matheson let out a puff of smoke. "If they are, maybe they're taking this whole
thing a bit too seriously," she said simply.
