Matthew rushed over to his fellows. It was a hot night and they were taking air
in the garden just outside the dance hall. Their jackets on the railings, their
shirtsleeves rolled up, they were smoking and talking in low raspy voices when
he appeared.

"What is it, Matty? You look like you just seen the devil himself."

"It's nothing, I have to get back in there," he was smiling, his cheeks were
red. "I asked the band leader to play _Everybody loves my Baby_. I'm gonna ask
Louise to dance with me."

"Easy there, Matty, you'll huff yourself to death," and they all laughed at
their own youth an  vigor. But all he could think about were her black hair and
brown eyes.

It was the last night of summer. The next day they would all ship off to
Berkeley, Brown, Harvard, and West Point.
