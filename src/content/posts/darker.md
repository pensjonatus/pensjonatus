"Hey, you got a minute?" Bill was standing at the entrance to her cubicle. She
turned away from the computer and smiled.

"Yeah, I'm going to be leaving in a few minutes. I'm just IMing my boyfriend,
checking if he's ready. What's up?"

"It's about that report that is due Wednesday."

"Oh, right, I forgot all about it. Yeah, I'll be on it tomorrow."

"Could we meet for a few minutes to discuss it? Tomorrow, say, before lunch?"

"Sure, why not."

"Okay, I'll be out of your hair," said Bill and left.

He hesitated just outside the cubicle, hoping she would say something to call
him back, but she did not. He knew from the silence, that all the other ones
were empty.Â He thought of his apartment for a second and decided to try and get
a head start on tomorrow's work instead.
