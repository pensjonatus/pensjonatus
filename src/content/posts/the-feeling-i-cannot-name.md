I have seen you so many times, and you wore so many faces. I remember you as the
harpy, the valkyrie, the priestess. I will never be able to wipe your image from
my mind.

Straight from the train, I went to the theatre to see you on stage. You were
reclining on a simple chair, the set behind you pretending to be an all American
city apartment, and the man in front of you your lover who betrayed you. Your
hair was curly and golden, your lips red as the idea of red itself. You noticed
me and that broke your concentration for a flicker, your blue eyes wandered to
the night when we danced with each other from across the room. I could almost
see the artificial stars of the club reflected in the retinae... And then you
were back to the play.

I left the theatre after it was all over, into the snowy New York. I was walking
towards another depressing night. Each night drawing me closer to the sad veil
of nothing.
