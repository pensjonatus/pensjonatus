The music was dying down, the frontman was saying a final Thank you from the
stage, and I was recovering from the rage of the last song.

There was not a drop of blood on my face, not a scratch on me, I was unscathed.
The terror my muscles felt as adrenaline flushed over them was a sham, but that
did not matter. I got what I came for.

The girl was with me, she was standing in the crowd with the other girls and the
boys who lacked character. I went over to collect her and we walked outside,
across the parking lot, into the van.

"You're all sweaty," she said, wiping my forehead with her hand as she lay on
top of me.

"So are you," I said and we locked in a kiss.

We made love slowly, to a rhythm unlike the rhythm of the night. All the
aggression gone, I let her drink from the reservoir of energy I accumulated. I
let her hide within my strength. We fell asleep at the break of dawn, as the
whoops around us were subsiding.
