My brother's homecoming was like in the movies. He got off the bus in a uniform,
a large bag over his shoulder, and he immediately got the respect of the older
generation.

Now, we were standing a few steps away from each other at the creek, where we
used to play as kids. He was wearing regular clothes, but his hair was still
short, and his face still brownish from the foreign sun.

I did not know what to say, neither did he. There was the usual "Hey, remember
when we used to..." and of course he remembered. Finally:

"So what are you gonna do now that the war is over?"

"There's always war somewhere."
