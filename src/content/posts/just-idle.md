I sent this beautiful creature a text: "Will you join me in the plaza?" but did
not wait for a response, I just went. I sat at one of those round tables, did
not order any coffee, and waited.

Later, at the party she said looking at her phone: "Oh, you sent me a text. I
did not see it."

"Yeah, that's okay."

"Sorry I missed the opportunity, I would have loved to go the plaza with you,"
she fluttered her thick lashes, her dark eyes mesmerizing.

"No worries," I said, "I just went by myself."

"By yourself? What did you do?" she sounded surprised and a little jealous. This
was the first time I did something without her.

"Nothing. I just stared at the mountains."

"That's it? That must have been so nice. Peaceful."

I wanted to reply, bu she said: "So what do you want to do tomorrow morning."

Meanwhile, the party continued around us, not aware that this beautiful creature
was rushing it.
