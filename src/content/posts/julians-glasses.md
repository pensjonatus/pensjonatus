"Hey, Monica," Sarah kissed her friend on the cheek. They hugged for half a
second, but tenderly.

It was a sixties-style cafe, with colorful furniture and murals of Audrey
Hepburn. The two girls ordered some fashionable coffee and talked about this and
that. Finally, they got to the point.

"So, how was Marsha's housewarming?" asked Sarah.

"Oh, it was so good. It's a shame you couldn't come."

"Yeah, you know. My boss is an asshole. Anyway?"

"Anyway, Julian was there."

"Which one is he?"

"The one we thought was slightly retarded."

"Oh yeah," Sarah tapped her lower lip, "He played the guitar. He was so cool.
Why did we think he was retarded anyway?"

"Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it was the glasses? He wore them like that, like very
low on his nose. And his nose was pretty short. And he kind of tilted his head
like that. But he does that to give a certain, you know, impression. He's really
sensitive. He has this creativity that is just... Out of this world."

"I bet," said Sarah, smiling, "So, what did you do?"

"Oh, I pretended I didn't remember him, and then I made an excuse to go into the
other room. He caught up with me later and told me this funny story. He's really
funny."

"So did you give him you number?"

"He didn't ask for it. He asked me on a date."

"Did you say yes?"

"I did. But it's kind of hard for me. I can't cancel last minute like I usually
do, because I don't have his number. And I can't just stand him up, he's too
sweet. And too cute and funny. It would be too much risk."

"I know" said Sarah, "Why don't you find him on Facebook or something, and send
him a message. That way he will have a way to get back to you and ask for
another date."

"Sounds like a good plan."

Suddenly, the world got colder and darker. Everything slowed down to a grotesque
pace. The sun trembled a little outside the window. God chose this very moment
to end the world and all of existence.
