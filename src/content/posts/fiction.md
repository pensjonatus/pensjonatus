The writer was having breakfast at a waffle house when a young man approached.

"Hi, I'm sorry. Are you Jeff Wilkowsky."

"Yes, that's me."

"Oh my God. Sorry to bother you, I was just sitting over there with my friends
and I... I recognized you from the back cover of the book. I don't mean to
disturb your morning, but wow. Can I have your autograph?"

"Sure," said the writer.

"You're Jeff Wilkowsky?" asked the woman in the next booth.

The writer nodded.

"You know, you shouldn't write those things about Lord Jesus. You cannot put
your own thoughts into Jesus's mouth. He is a historical figure and his opinions
are well-documented. You cannot deny that."

"Yes, ma'am," started the writer, but the young man interrupted.

"Hey, lady, the Bible is fanfiction about God and Jesus is a cartoonish
superhero. You're a typical fundamentalist Christian nut job. You people are the
reason everybody makes fun of Americans. I'm gonna tweet about you, lady."

He turned to the writer.

"Thanks for the autograph and sorry for the interruption," and then he kind of
stormed off.

The writer looked at the lady, she seemed angry and hurt.

"Sorry about that," he said.
