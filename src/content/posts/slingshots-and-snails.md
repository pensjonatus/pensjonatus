Jeannie was sitting on the couch, Jake was playing a video game.

"Urgh, Jake. What is it with you and this game. Can't you spend some time with
me? You're my boyfriend after all."

He paused it. "Sorry, Jeannie. Yeah, I was gonna. I was just relaxing after work
when you walked in so I thought I'd finish."

"Whatever," she threw a mascot at him, laughing, "I gotta take a shower anyway."

When she walked out, he resumed playing. He was thinking of the nice things he
could say when she got back. She was thinking about giving him a kiss.
