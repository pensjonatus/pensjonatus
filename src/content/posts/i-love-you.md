She rolled over to her side of the bed and closed her eyes. Her face was calm
and relaxed. The sheets were white, her black skin in stark contrast. The
afternoon was full of light. I heard her begin to snore a little.

"K*ocham cię*" I said.

"What's that?" she awoke and opened her eyes slightly.

"It's Polish for _I love you_."

"I didn't plan on making it a thing between us or anything. You know, me saying
_I love you_ in Polish. That's not what I was going for. I just started dozing
off and I felt this warmth towards you. So I said it. Not realizing I was
speaking Polish until I was halfway through."

Her eyes were open wide now. She was smiling. She bit her lip. "I like it when
you talk. Talk some more," she said.
