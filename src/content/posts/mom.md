People say some young folks took a road trip once. They took out a van, packed
it full of supplies and drove off towards the horizon. A couple of days into the
trip, they set up camp in a clearing in a wooded area. They had blankets and
food and they talked and laughed.

People say one of the kids suddenly felt the need to relieve himself, and all he
needed was some toilet paper. So he said to his girlfriend:

"Where is the toilet paper?"

"It's over there," she said.

He did not intend to say what he said next: "Where, mom?"

People say everybody stopped what they were doing and looked up at him. The
forest was a silent witness to the horror.
