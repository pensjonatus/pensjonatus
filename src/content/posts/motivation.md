"Ms. Vernon," said the young girl in jean overalls and pink-rimmed glasses, "I loved your talk."

"Thank you, but please, call me Jane."

They were at the coffee area of the Women in Tech Conference. Jane Vernon was with her partner drinking a cup of brownish swill.

"I especially loved the things you said about motivation," said the girl, "About the small things that carry us over. The joy of of reaching your destination, a warm hat, a smile from a stranger. I also admire your work. You're such an inspiration."

Jane Vernon smiled blankly. "Thank you, dear." And the girl scurried away awkwardly.

Jane turned to her partner and said "This coffee tastes like shit."
