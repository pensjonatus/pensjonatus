I had never been to Morocco, but I kind of had a feel for it. Warm and gold,
with beautiful radiant light during the day. Very fine ornamental bars in the
window, simple furniture, and the street outside full of foreign words. Perhaps
there is tea and coffee and drugs, and an orgy in the other room with young boys
being hung and ejaculating as they die. That's what William Boroughs wrote about
Morocco, I think.

So the place we arrived in was like that. And there was an intricate golden box
on the table. It was resting on a red velveteen cushion, tired after a long day
of being a box. The sun was setting outside and I knew our time would run out as
the first rays of darkness hit us.

But my wife was desperate to keep a memory of the place (and her memory was not
good in those days), so she grabbed the box before it was too late and held it
close to her chest. To her breasts.

Outside, in the busy market, a ferryman was calling passengers. "Carcosa!
Carcosa!" But I think nobody believed he could go there.

And when we were transported back, my wife still had the box. Let me tell you
what was inside.
