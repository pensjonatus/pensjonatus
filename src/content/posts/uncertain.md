My girlfriend, before she even became my girlfriend, was a barista at the coffee
place I used to stop by before work. We were friends on Facebook and she always
said a special hi and smiled at me, but she said a special hi and smiled at
everyone, at least that is what I thought. I knew she must get a lot of
attention from men, she was beautiful and approachable, and there was this
feeling of general good will around her. It was like she cared about everyone,
and when you were with her, you felt very special.

But I figured everyone got that from her, so when we talked, I sometimes made
fun of that. Especially later, when I started meeting her at parties and such. I
would pretend to be coming on to her as a joke, ironically, to suggest I would
never want that. And she would play along and we would make fun of it.

Other times, I was just nice to her, but then she kept me at a distance. One
night at a party in the Valley, we sat together, just the two of us, and talked
for a while. Somewhere in the middle of that I said:

"Listen, sometimes I am a little harsh with you."

"That's okay," she said and did a cute thing with her hair. That annoyed me a
little.

"I am sorry I am like that, it's just that sometimes I feel bad around you. I
feel like you treat me like one of those guys who are just trying to pick you
up. We're friends, I'm in a relationship, you know that, right? I hate it when
you treat me like one of the guys who are trying to get with you."

She just smiled. That annoyed me a little. I don't know how we ended up
together, but it seems like some kind of a ninja thing.
