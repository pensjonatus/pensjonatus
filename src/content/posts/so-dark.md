I sit in my cubicle, and I am bored. These tasks are too easy, a monkey could do
them. It is a good cover though, for a man like me. I get up and take a walk to
the copy machine, just to shake this feeling of boredom.

I look at people on the way. Melinda is a redhead with a pale face. I would love
to cut her scalp and see blood run down. Her eyes would look good surrounded by
streaks of red.

Jen is a strong woman, a boss. I would love to chain her down in my basement and
torture her for months. Finally, when her spirit was broken, I would skin her
alive and wear her like a suit.

This new girl, I do not know her name, is so cute. She is nothing like the rest,
she would understand. I would take a little slice of her every day and eat it.
And she would cover it up and go to work anyway, pretending like we do not know
each other.

I am back in my cubicle. I close the spreadsheet and go to YouTube to watch a
gruesome video. I am unaffected. I watch horror films all the time and I am not
scared. I also love those real videos of people getting hurt. I live for that. I
have no human emotions. I am so fucking dark.
