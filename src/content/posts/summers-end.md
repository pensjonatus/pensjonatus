Ivan was sitting by the pool, watching the sun set slowly over the buildings of
the country club. All the towels had been put away and locked, as were the
folding chairs, and he was off the clock. The cool air was trying to bite his
skin, unaware he came from cold regions far away and this feeble frost meant
nothing to him. Nevertheless, he noticed and greeted it with a smile.

The end of the season meant he had to move on. Perhaps east, deeper into the
great continent to find work at a diner, a construction site, or a
slaughterhouse. A man like him could do anything in this land of opportunity. He
was ready, but still, he felt nostalgia as he prepared himself mentally. He
planned his next steps: back to the shabby cabin, pack up his backpack, go to
sleep, wake up tomorrow, hitch a ride into town, get a bus ticket.

He thought about summers in the old country when he was a boy. His aunt had a
beach house, so his whole family would take the train and leave the hot, smelly
city to visit her among the grassy dunes. His father would hunt for butterflies
with a net on a stick, and his mother would serve apple pie. The old kind, with
crunchy crust and powdered sugar on top. And his sister would sing, that is if
she was not out there in the world chasing boys. But that was all history.

He saw Ben and Tina, an American couple who worked their summer jobs here.
Normally, you could see them argue, but not today. They were walking hand in
hand, their silhouettes perfectly vivid against the white panels of the
hospitality building, their young heads together as they spoke sweet promises
softly. The summer was ending, as must all things.
