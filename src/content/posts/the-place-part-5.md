Carcosa! If I heard it in any other context, I would have thought it was just a
place in, maybe, South America. But I heard it in the place and I knew it had to
be something special. The fabled city, as I later learned.

Let me tell you all about it, but first there's my wife. We were sitting on the
porch, even though it was an unseasonably cold evening. My wife insisted, even
though she's usually the one who is cold. So we wrapped ourselves in multiple
blankets and sat out there with hot cocoa.

She told me poems that came to her mind and I listened. Her poems used to scare
me at first, but then we went into therapy together and I began to accept her
for who she was, so I accepted the poems too.

She recited poems about a tin man who was looking for purpose in life, even
though other tin men already had a purpose and he could have just used one of
their purposes. The other tin men wanted to kill him, but they did not know how
and that made me sad. It was a beautiful poem, albeit a little off beat.

I felt sexual attraction to my wife as we sat there, because her body was warm
and soft. My wiener got hard and I felt ashamed. She did not know, or pretended
not to know. She whistled the tune that first got us into the place, and then
she stopped.

"I have another premonition," she said. "I can get us into the place again, if
you just trust me."

"I always trust you," I said.
