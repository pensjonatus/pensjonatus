"Hey, so this campus is really nice," I said.

We were standing in a cafe-library, a fifth of sixth spot on this sightseeing tour. Jim was wearing a Kurt Cobain type sweater, he was smiling slightly. When we had met that day, it was after not having seen each other for months. He hugged me which made me uncomfortable because he was gay.

"Yeah, it's nice. You want to see my dorm room?"

I agreed. We stepped outside into the windy mid-afternoon, there were crowds of people around.

"Do you think people can tell I am Polish."

"Well, I'm sure they can tell you're not from around here," said Jim.

"How come?"

"I don't know," he blushed slightly, "Maybe it's the cheekbones?"

The dorm was a vast building, as empty as a mausoleum. It was probably new, maybe not fully populated yet. Jim's room was at the end of a long hallway. It was nice and cool; all you could see outside the window were trees.

"You like it?"

"It's really peaceful," I said.

The sheets smelled nice and fresh. I wanted to lie down and sleep, but I did not want his dick up my anus, so I said:

"Hey, let's get out of here."

"Sure, that sounds good," he replied.
