"Hey," the girl sat down next to me at the kitchen table. It was a party and it
was 3 am. "Do you bowl?"

"Oh, the shirt?" I said, "No, I thought we were supposed to wear costumes. I'm
Jesus from _The Big Lebowski_."

"I haven't seen that," she said and started eating her bowl of ramen noodles. I
thought she would start talking to me again, but the pause got awkwardly long
and then I could not think of anything to say. All of a sudden, we were beyond
the point where I began to look like an inarticulate idiot and nothing I could
ever say would make sense.

"So you like ramen, huh?" I said, like an idiot.

She nodded, swallowing aÂ  bunch of noodles.

"That's all I used to eat when I was in college. No money."

She nodded. Her not answering was making things even worse. And just when I
thought nothing could change the situation to my advantage, space locusts
attacked the Earth and I became a hero who saved her.

Just kidding, the whole thing never happened. I'm too shy to go to parties.
