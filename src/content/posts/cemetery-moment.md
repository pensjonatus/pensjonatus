He stood over the grave. It was a sunny day, the grass was green, the birds were
singing and it seemed like a perfect time to do this. He wanted to speak out
loud, but there were people about, somebody raking leaves, a family visiting
another grave, so he just thought.

"I came here to say that it is okay," he thought, "All the things you did. I
forgive you. I am over it."

He looked over his shoulder, he could see his car, and his girlfriend in the
passenger seat. They were going to get something to eat after this, but that did
not matter. Only the moment mattered. It had to be perfect.

He became aware of his appearance. He was wearing a shirt and jeans. He could
have worn a jacket at least, would make it a little bit better. But this was
okay too, this could work.

"I am all grown up now," he got back to thinking, "And you cannot hurt me
anymore."

He wished he could see himself from a distance, standing over the grave. The man
raking the leaves would not be in the shot, and neither would be the other
family. And you would not be able to see the road was so close, with cars
parked. It would just be a great green meadow with white tombstones and a
solitary man making peace with his past.
