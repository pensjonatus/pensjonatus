Have you noticed we never run out of things to talk about? Your hair looks beautiful. You seem to be the only person who understands me. I'll be honest with you, I've never felt like this before. You cure my blues. A condom numbs the sensation, I can't feel anything. I know this may sound like a line, but your voice is amazing. I will always love you. Can you come over tonight? I'm lonely. What do you mean we never talk, we're talking right now. I'm falling in love with you all over again. This song was playing when we first kissed. I never get bored when I am with you. I could look into your eyes all night. I want to make you come. Are these pretzels for everybody? General, you cannot let them get away with the code, the lives of millions of people on the West Coast are at stake.
