"When I woke up this morning, I thought I heard heavenly music. It was so
beautiful, like one hundred million angels were playing their biblical
instruments. Up in heaven. Then I realized I was hearing the bells on Balkan

"No, Craig," she said teary-eyed.

"Do you know what I mean by this, Sally?"

"No, Craig. Not again, please."

"I know what you're thinking, but it's different. It's real. I hear the calling.
He is beckoning me."

"Please, Craig," she started sobbing.

"Hush, don't worry about anything. Don't you worry about a thing. It's going to

The night was quiet, nothing stirred. No ominous birds in the sky, no scary
shadows. Nothing to usher in the days that were coming. Only her silent sobs and
spasms. Only his sad smile.
