"I met him when the bars were closed," she said. "I wanted to get a drink but it
was too late. Our town is small. Most people go to bed early to get up for work.
They are tired from working in the garden, attending PTA meetings, and reading
the Bible.

"Beneath the streetlight," she said, "He was the most beautiful thing I ever
saw. My thirst and desperation were gone and all I could do was tremble in his
overwhelming presence. He was powerful and evident. Like a black tower suddenly
erect in the middle of the city. Except he was not. He was almost like you and
me, flesh and blood.

"I told him I wanted to get somewhere and do something, he said nothing. I
smiled and flirted, but he seemed not to care. I wanted to get to know him, but
he would not let me.

"I dreaded the moment when the sun would rise. I would have to leave him and go
back home, sleep an hour or two, go to work. There would have to be clothes
considered, a shower, food, small talk, reports.

"But in that perfect moment," she said, "I was with him, in the middle of that
deserted street. He was such a beautiful hobo corpse and I was madly in love."
