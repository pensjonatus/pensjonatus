The number four streetcar rolled away just as I reached the stop, so I missed
it, but I was lucky because another number four rolled right behind it. It was
odd, I admit, but I quite enjoyed the ride. Other than me, there were three
people on board, as a child observed. It was more or less like that all the way
because everybody got on board the first number four and only stragglers got on
board this one.

I noticed the driver really took his time and he even stopped among the trees
for a minute, even though there were no traffic lights in view. I approached him
then.

"You know, it's very crafty of you," I said

"You mean that in a good way?"

"Of course," and we fist-bumped.
