Kevin was a weird kid and I could never relate to him. There was a bunch of us who never took the bus after school because we lived so close. We always walked the six blocks to Maple Drive and then our ways parted. We laughed, joked around, or talked about awesome stuff like robots and cars, and when we were older, girls. Kevin was always a few steps behind, never with us. Back then, I was sure he thought he was better than us.

I met Kevin at the reunion last year. I remember I recognized him instantly, the slanted shoulders, the blond mop of hair, the pale blue eyes. His girl or wife, whoever she was, had a really hot body, I think she was some kind of model. I walked up to them.

"Hey, Kevin. Long time no see. How are you doing?"

He looked up slowly. "I'm sorry, you are?"

"It's Jim. Jim Starsky."

There was not a flicker of recognition.

"We went to the same primary, junior high, and high. Don't you remember me? I used to live down the street from you."

"I'm sorry, Jim. I can't say that I do."
