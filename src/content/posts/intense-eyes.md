He entered and saw his wife's new secretary. Their eyes met, and he might have
lingered a little too long.

"Hi, I'm Thomas... McClintock. Amanda's husband."

"Nice to meet you, Thomas," she replied, "I'm Jane." She smiled a satisfied
cat's smile.

"It's a pleasure. Is she in?"

"Yes, but she's in a meeting, would you like to wait?"

He lingered again. "No, just give this to her," he handed her an envelope.
"Thanks," and he stepped outside.

young, probably her first job or almost. The eyes were still young and full of
confidence that comes from mistakenly thinking we already know it all. The type
of eyes that look wonderful when they close once ecstasy turns out to be greater
than experienced ever before.

He pictured the girl getting on the train to get back home after work. He almost
regretted not being young and poor and not taking the train too, so that he
could run into her by chance and talk innocently, but with intentions.
