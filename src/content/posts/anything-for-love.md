It was late, it was Paris, and they had a wonderful day behind them. She looked
into his dark eyes.

"I never knew I could feel this way," she said, "I love you so much."

He looked back into her eyes, deep, deep, deep. "I love you too," he said, and
she knew he was sincere.

"I would do anything for you," she said.

"Anything?"

Fear flashed in her eyes, but then courage overpowered it. She knew everything
had to be done for love. "Anything," she whispered, closing, her eyes.

He got closer to her. Squeezed her hand.

"Come on, let's go then," he shouted and they ran through the streets like
crazy, laughing.

They ended up in a cafe where he revealed his wish and she complied. She ate
thirty crepes. Then he took her to the Eiffel Tower and she climbed the outside
of it, a good thirty feet up. Then she had to live in the docks for thirty
years, training thirty penguins to do a circus act. When that was done, she
looked deep into his dark eyes.

"Do you believe me now?" she asked.

There were tears in his eyes. "I do," he said. "I do."
