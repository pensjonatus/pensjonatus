I woke up in a medical-type room. What do you call one of those? A medical-type
room was all I could think of, my mind was so woozy. It was one of those bright
clean rooms with tiles. A medical-typ room.

There was a doctor there, as evidenced by his clothes and the context, and also
by what he said: "How are you feeling?"

I defied the question by not answering it directly: "You are helping me stay
alive," I said, "Why? I mean, probably not me personally. Just the mass of
people, me being one of them. Why?"

The doctor looked surprised. He (she?) thought for a little bit and said: "I did
not expect this question. Usually, people would ask me about their condition,
that sort of thing. You yourself were quite close to dying, I must say. But let
me answer, because the question intrigues me personally. Why do I help the mass
of people stay alive? I suppose there's something wrong with dying. Something
irregular with being sick. All my career and education I've been told what's not
allowed to be, that being sick or dead, and I've also been told how to make it
not-so. So I think this is the honest reply. And I feel like I hadn't considered
it before, which is strange, given how thoughtful I consider myself."

I though about his words a little and considered how in touch with his emotions
he was, like someone well-therapised by a well-meaning therapist in a genuine
psychological practice. I was completely sidetracked by this, so much so, that I
was no longer able to recall the very content of his response. I tried piecing
it back together and something about non-appropriateness came to me.

"The manual," I said, "lists things which are not appropriate to be. The manual
for doctors. It tells you people should not be sick or dead. And you spend your
time preventing them from being so?"

"Yes."

"Is that the right thing to do?"

"I believe people want me to help them. Usually. Consider pain and discomfort.
Considered lowered quality of life. Or death which is the very definition of an
opposite of life."

"Yes, quite so," I admitted.

"Except in cases like yours, where the subject seems at first to be of a
different mind. Their problems stemming, so to say, from a decision to go
against the grain, so to say. Only this decision is usually a symptom of
illness. And they would regret their decision, if given the chance to get
better. If the initial symptom were to go away."

"I see where you are going with this," I said. "I hope you succeeded, though
things looked dicey, I must say. I was pretty thorough and making sure my
decision was permanent. I hope I did not, in fact, die, and I hope this is not
the afterlife with me being deceived and then punished.

The doctor chuckled: "Yes, I hope so too."
