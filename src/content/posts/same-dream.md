Now tell me this, professor, and I keep coming back to this, why do people on this planet all have the same dream every night?

The people listening at home may know I'm a relative newcomer. I came on the Hermes Line about six years ago. And before I came, I was like everyone else on other worlds: I did not believe the stories. I thought it was a hoax, or maybe some local custom. I mean, I thought it was customary to claim you have the same dream.

But my first night here, my very first night, I had the dream. Exactly like I've heard it described. The details. The details have not varied ever since, not even once. None of it is different. It's always the same dream. Now how is that possible?

Our brains are similar, but they are not all the same. Is there some environmental factor that influences everybody? Is that even feasible? What is the likelihood that something exists on a faraway world that is compatible with human biology? Is it a gas? Is it the sun?

People think it's coming from the sun, and I think so too. Though I don't know how or why. I mean, the brain could be influenced by radiation, but we don't see any patterns in any of the data. There is no "signal". Is there some intent behind it?

Now, it's really tempting to think that there is someone out there who cares about us and is trying to communicate. Even if it is unsuccessful communication, it would at least be comforting to know that it is an attempt at communication. But I don't know.

Or is it something in our human nature that makes us have this dream. But why only here.

I don't know. I always start this topic and never know where to take it. I hope that if I bring it up enough times, there is eventually a breakthrough. I don't know. Maybe next time.
