Now tell me this, professor, and I keep coming back to this, why do people on
this planet all have the same dream every night?

The people listening at home may know I'm a relative newcomer. I came on the
Hermes Line about six years ago. And before I came, I was like everyone else on
other worlds: I did not believe the stories. I thought it was a hoax, or maybe
some local custom. I mean, I thought it was customary to claim you have the same
dream.

But my first night here, my very first night, I had the dream. Exactly like I've
heard it described. The details. The details have not varied ever since, not
even once. None of it is different. It's always the same dream. Now how is that
possible?

Our brains are similar, but they are not all the same. Is there some
environmental factor that influences everybody? Is that even feasible? What is
the likelihood that something exists on a faraway world that is compatible with
human biology? Is it a gas? Is it the sun?

People think it's coming from the sun, and I think so too. Though I don't know
how or why. I mean, the brain could be influenced by radiation, but we don't see
any patterns in any of the data. There is no "signal". Is there some intent
behind it?

Now, it's really tempting to think that there is someone out there who cares
about us and is trying to communicate. Even if it is unsuccessful communication,
it would at least be comforting to know that it is an attempt at communication.
But I don't know.

Or is it something in our human nature that makes us have this dream. But why
only here.

I don't know. I always start this topic and never know where to take it. I hope
that if I bring it up enough times, there is eventually a breakthrough. I don't
know. Maybe next time.
