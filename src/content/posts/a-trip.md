Harr wanted to take a trip with his friends. That was his first thought when he
woke up and he decided that would be his major task for the day.

He slid out of his cot and wobbled to his breakfast area. As he ripped off
morsels and put them in his gob, he ruminated over the list of friends he would
like to invite:

- Sam always remembered things, so he would make sure that they bring their
  water, etc., a useful person to have on the trip

- Snail always had good stories to tell.

- Gel and Faith were funny = nice company.

- Tim was too self-absorbed, so not a good companion. But Tim had invited Harr
  to his wedding, so Harr was obligated.

- Meggy could sing and would be pleasant to be around on the way to the place.

Right, the place. Where should they go?

It had been a few days, so Harr decided to check the pond, see if there were any
algae to be harvested. As Harr put on his leg warmers, he started thinking about
the place. He was picturing somewhere with greenery and big, big trees. But
somewhere that is not overwhelming with smells and heat. A nice cool area, maybe
high in the mountains. He waded in the cool water of the lake and thought it
felt nice to be flooded with cold, surrounded by cold, and feel the cold
pressure. So he locked in the decision.

As soon as he got back into the house, he sat in front of the computer. The
tubes and cables took a toll on his health, he knew that, but he was willing to
make the sacrifice. As he scrolled over the map, the computer drained some of
his life fluids and injected them into its hungry network, making the image
clearer and less shaky. The computer injected some of the fluids from the
network back into Harr, making him smell smells he had never smelled and half
remember places he had never been to. Harr focused on not losing sight of the
trip and, after a little while, he got back on task.

The hypsometric map now had its crosshairs on the elevation he liked, so he
toggled over to the life view, to gauge the plant life. Everything whirred as he
did so, and he felt voices of his distant countrymen scream for justice as they
were being forced into labor. He suppressed the emotion and re-focused on the
task. He zeroed-in on an area with the right amount of plant life and made sure
there were no big poisonous predators there. He now toggled to transportation
options.

A surge of ecstasy shook his tendrils as his engram was flooded with suggestions
of pleasure services, but he punched through to a ferry company which also
offered land cars for the final leg of the journey. He shared his signature with
them to make a reservation and they suggested a time. He made a note of that in
his own cortex, so that it would be available when he went offline. He did the
same with the local area map for the destination. You never know.

Next, he switched over to the messaging service, feeling his life force wane as
the computer charged him the fees. He felt he was losing something of himself as
he became more and more attuned. He composed a message for Sam, Snail, Gel,
Faith, Tim, and Meggy. It contained the time and date, the starting point, the
destination, and the sense of community he was hoping to feel. The messaging
service strengthened that last aspect, trying to encourage Harr's friends to
respond to the message. It had its own agenda, but Harr let it, because he was
hoping to hear back from at least some of them. They could pick it up if they
came online before the trip. Hopefully, they would all be there on the day.

Harr disconnected and looked around his home. He let himself readjust to his
surroundings, the many holes and crevices of the building, the light shining
through the translucent membranes, and beyond, the bodies of his neighbors
scuttling about in their homes. A wave of emotion washed over him and he
compared his former perception of the home with what he it was now. He wondered
about years and years ago, and the many experiences like this one he had. He
wondered what his younger self would think of him now. He hoped it would be
empathetic and understanding, as he was towards it.
