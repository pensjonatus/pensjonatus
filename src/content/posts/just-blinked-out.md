I do not remember what I was doing on the day some of the stars disappeared from
the sky. I did not even know it happened because you cannot see the stars in the
city. I found out the next day, when people were talking about it at the office.

A bunch of stars went dark, leaving a small black hole in the sky. Not bigger
than a penny, but nevertheless, pretty scary. Especially if you imagine these
stars are not all together, by spread across billions of light years. The
obvious thought was that there was something in the way, blocking the view, but
scientists were divided on whether that was the case. Also, a few other stars
here and there all across the sky were extinguished as well.

Around that time, I had a huge fight with Beth and then she was killed in a road
accident. Last words we exchanged were words of anger. Years later, I am not
sure if it was the same day as the stars or not.
