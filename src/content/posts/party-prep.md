JillÂ was chopping up the vegetables, and Jack was frying up the meat. They were
preparing food for the party.

"Hey Jill, can you make them finer?"

"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at
thee."

He did not smile. He put some more oregano on the meat.

"You're making them too big, I'm gonna have to redo them."

"Tread carefully," she said, "For you are treading on my dreams."
