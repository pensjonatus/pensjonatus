"Hey, can I get that coffee?"

"Coming right up, sweetie," Selma reassured the customer in the corner. "I'll be
right back, Vlad," she said to me.

I was flipping burgers on the giant skillet, sweat dripping down my back. I had
gotten used to it. I could cool down chopping onions, or getting something from
the walk-in fridge.

Selma was back sooner than I expected.

"Where was I? Oh yeah," she said, "So anyway, Trevor was a travelling salesman
and his route was from New York to Maine. I was still living in Vermont. He
would stop by sometimes, tell me all sorts of stories. And then that one time he
came over, telling me he was getting married. My little brother was getting
married. I was surprised, couldn't you have called, I said. No, he wanted to
tell me in person. So asked him who was the girl and he told me her name was
Sarah and that she was Jewish. And I'm like, that's okay, 'cause I'm no
anti-seemite. And anyway, my friend was Jewish, her name was Debbie. I don't
know if it's a Jewish name. Is it?"

"It is," I said. "It's Deborah. A typically Jewish name."

"Yeah, you're a smart one. What's your business flipping burgers anyway, huh?"

"It's a good job, isn't it."

"I guess it is. Hey, what kind of a name is Vlad? Are you from Transylvania? Is
Poland in Transylvania?" hard to say whether she was joking. A little smile
never left her face.

"Nah," I smiled back, "My name is _Vladek_, Vlad for short."

"You got any brothers or sisters, Vlad?"

"I do." I made her wait a second, "Eight in all. Three brothers and five
sisters."

"Well, you're something else. Is it common in Poland?"

"Oh yeah, most men have many wives. My father has three."

"Huh, look at that. Are you a Muslim?"

"No, we're Buddhist. A lot of people in Poland are."

She looked down a second, then up at me again. She was probably about fifty, but
her eyes looked sharp. They were bright blue and extremely intelligent. She
winked at me and smiled.

"You wouldn't be trying to make a fool out of old Selma, would you."

I felt my cheeks were getting hot. I looked down, could not bear to look at her.

"Sorry, Selma. I was just having some fun."

"Thought so, kid. Thought so."

And she walked away to greet a customer. I planned what I was going to say when
she came back. Something to serve as a peace offering. And also to find out
whether she was mad.
