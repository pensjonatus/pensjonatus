Steve was sipping on some latte at a cafe when Molly walked up.

"Steve? Steve Warynsky? Oh my God, it is you!"

"Hey, Molly, it's been years," he got up and then got awkward for a second.
Should he hug her? Should he kiss her? They sat.

"So are you here for the kung fu tournament, Steve?" she asked.

"Oh, no. I don't do that anymore. I'm kind of lazy now," he patted his stomach,
"But you're still into it? You're in great shape."

"Thanks. Yeah, I'm here with the old club from Michigan. Well, I say old club
but you wouldn't know anyone anymore. How long has it been? Five years?"

"Yeah, that sounds about right," he said.

"What have you been doing?"

"Let's see," he said, "I graduated from college went on to work for Dynacore
Industries. I'm here on a boring business trip. So how's old Saganoga? Anything
new in town?"

"Well, we have a new sheriff. And," she paused, "I don't know. Nothing to do as
usual. A lot of the old gang moved out and it's been boring. But hey, I keep
busy with martial arts. I'm an instructor now."

"Hey, good for you," he smiled. "I'm really happy I bumped into you."

"Me too, Steve"

They laughed and talked on and on until a tall blonde in a business suit walked
up. She looked at Molly, then turned to Steve and smiled.

"I'm sorry, Steven. I need you back at the compound."

"Thanks, Victoria. Sorry, Molly, but I have to run. It's been really great
meeting you. Listen, stay in touch."

"You bet," Molly gave him the old thumbs up.

And he left. No hug or kiss this time either. As he was getting into the car
with Victoria, he felt sick to the stomach and his head was spinning.

"Are you all right, Steven?" Victoria asked.

"Yeah. Oh, and call me Steve."
