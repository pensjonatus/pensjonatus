Theo was sitting on the porch, looking at the rain. It was hot and the rain was
only slightly refreshing amidst the heatwave. The street was empty, except for
the drops, and if he got off the porch, he could look down to Main Street, but
would probably not see it in the haze. His paper route used to lead down there
when he was a little boy.

The door creaked and Meg joined him. She brought two glasses of iced tea and
they drank. She was wearing a flowery dress, her hair was pulled back to let her
neck cool. Her eyes looked lazy.

"What are you thinking?" she asked after a while.

"Nothing, just thinking about going back to D.C. after all this. How about you?
Are you better, Meg?"

"I am better," she said.

She looked at him intensely, he suppressed a smile. He took a cool sip, his head
was getting hot. They listened to the rain.

"You need to start getting back to reality, Meg," he said. "You've been trough
hell, now you need to get on your feet again."

"Uh-hum," she said, sipping.

"You are down to half a pill a day, right? You'll be off in a week. Have you
called university to see if they will take you back?"

"I—" she started, "I am not sure I want to."

"You will feel better once you're around people again," he tried to assure her
and himself.

"I am feeling kind of holy," she said,

"Holy?"

"Holy," she said, "As in a lot of holes. Or one important hole. I am not sure
which it is."

Theo was tired of these conversations. Tired of her problems.

They listened to the rain some more.
