I was on a train back home and the world was whooshing by. I was tired, could barely think, so I decided to let someone else control my mind for a minute and read a book. But the book was boring and I kept looking up at other commuters.

There was a girl there, with copper hair and a purple hat, she was playing with her phone. She kept looking at me. Just short glances from time to time. And then back to her phone with a mysterious smile.

At some point, she got pale and serious. What was she thinking? Was she thinking about me looking at her?Â Was she thinking about talking to me? Was she thinking about kissing me? That last one made me shudder. I wondered what my boyfriend would think, and we whooshed away.
