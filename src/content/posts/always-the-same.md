I was on a train back home and the world was whooshing by. I was tired, could
barely think, so I decided to let someone else control my mind for a minute and
read a book. But the book was boring and I kept looking up at other commuters.

There was a girl there, with copper hair and a purple hat, she was playing with
her phone. She kept looking at me. Just short glances from time to time. And
then back to her phone with a mysterious smile.

At some point, she got pale and serious. What was she thinking? Was she thinking
about me looking at her? Was she thinking about talking to me? Was she thinking
about kissing me? That last one made me shudder. I wondered what my boyfriend
would think, and we whooshed away.
