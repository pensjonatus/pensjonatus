I am so glad I survived the night. Thunder woke me up in the morning.

My dad thought it would be hard to survive the night and I think he was right, in the end. He had said we needed water and protection from the Holy Cross. He had said only our Lord Jesus Christ could protect us on a night like that. I thought it was a night like any other, but I guess I was wrong.

Dad tried to get me that night. He crawled after me. He has to crawl because he has no legs. And it is hard for him to crawl because he has only one arm. But I guess he is used to it. He has always been like this.

I hid in my room. I locked the door and went straight to bed. I woke up many times to drink water and to pee. I held the Holy Cross very close to my heart all the time. He did not get me.

I got out of my room in the morning. It was bright and hazy outside. I went downstairs. Mom was reading the paper in the kitchen, smoking.

"Thunder woke me up," I said.

"Sweetie," she said, "There was no thunder. There is no storm."
