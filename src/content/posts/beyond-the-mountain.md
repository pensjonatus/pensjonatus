Hunting was not going well. The two boys laid their bows by the river and
rested.

"All the deer are gone," said one.

"We will find some," said the other.

"How do you know? Maybe we've killed too many."

"There is plenty of deer over the mountain. They will come from there to feed
here. To drink the water."

"How do you know there is deer there? You have not been there. Nobody has."

"I know it is true. I saw it in a dream."

And that is how it all began. Now I am sitting here, in this New York cafe,
looking at the headlines. The President is taking us to war. His justification?
God told him to do it. I myself would rather bury my head in the bosom of a
young lady, but I will have to take up arms. It is a pity things must be so, for
I know I will be killed and will be no more.

My grandson will find my writings, read the story of the two boys, and he will
want to write as well. I hope he does not give it up.

Finally, the Sun will no longer be able to protect us and insane amounts of
deadly rays will kill all life on the planet. But the universe will go on.
