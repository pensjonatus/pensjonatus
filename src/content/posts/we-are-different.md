"Excuse me, is this the way to the meeting hall," the girl asked.

"Yes," the metallic voice was emotionless.

"Thank you," she was about to leave, but she hesitated. The mechanical man
seemed occupied with his thoughts. The girl admired his shiny casing and complex
gem-like eyes.

"I'm sorry to bother you, but-"

"Yes, can I help you further?" the mechanical man asked.

"I just wanted to ask you a personal question."

"Yes?"

"Are you old?"

The mechanical man laughed heartily. "Yes, young lady. By human standards, I am
very old."

"How old exactly?"

"I have been active for thousands of years."

"Is it true that organic humans were first? That they predate mechanical people
by millions of years?"

"That is quite true, young lady. I remember clearly, that the human civilization
was already advanced when the first of us were constructed."

"I see," she said. "I've never talked to one of you, sir."

"Why not?"

"There aren't many like you where I come from. But this city is different."

Another mechanical man emerged from a nearby door. His casing was red and he was
more bulky.

"Does this mortal have important business?" asked the red man.

The girl felt insignificant and useless. "No, sir," she said.

"well then hurry up, you're needed inside."

"I'm coming."

The mechanical man gave her a look before he followed the red man. She could not
read his emotions, though.
