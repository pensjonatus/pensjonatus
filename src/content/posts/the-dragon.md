Jenny was just a little girl before the dragon came. She was afraid of it before
she saw it. But then she loved it and could not get enough of it. The dragon
destroys virgins and makes them into monsters, and that was what happened to
Jenny.

When I first met her, she was giving blowjobs for money in Portland, Maine. She
said twenty bucks, no, fifteen. I told her she did not need to do that because I
was all righteous.

The second time I met her, I had been visited by the dragon several times
already. She had some of it, so we did it together. She told me all about being
her daddy's girl and going to church and how she was free to do what she wanted
now. To live or to die, that was what she said. I think the dragon set her free,
like it did all of us back in those years.

Now the dragon runs the whole world. Empires are made or broken because it
wishes so. Mothers do not recognize their children and the sun cannot find its
way into women's eyes. The wires run deep into the flesh of humanity, pumping
the dragon's blood and making everybody free. It is a bit gloomy and grey, but
we still have each other, Jenny and I.
