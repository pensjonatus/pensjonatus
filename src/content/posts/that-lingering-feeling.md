"So where's Kevin and Mordecai?" asked Kelly. She was alone with Bryan in the
bright conference room. He was wearing a fresh green sweater that reminded her
of nice weather and interesting conversations. He was smiling.

"They are not here today," said Bryan. "I can give it to them in our daily over
Skype."

"Alright," she sighed and then looked into her notes, "Plan for this week is
season 13, episode four through nine."

"What's your creative direction?"

"We want to bring John's old girlfriend into town. Let's make it into an arc
where John's wife is a little jealous, but she trusts him, while her sister will
keep playing up the whole situation like it's a problem. Let's build the
conflict on that."

"Okay, and what about John's feelings toward this old girlfriend?"

"I haven't made up my mind on that. Let's keep him being the good guy, though.
Maybe old feelings could rekindle, but he does not act on them?"

"Sounds like a cliche."

"I know," Kelly frowned, "You know my mind better then I do."

"What's it been now, Kelly? Ten years?"

"Yeah, I think something like that," she smiled at him, he smiled at her, the
green sweater remained a positive influence. "So what do you propose?"

"Maybe," he said, "They were in love but they no longer are. Maybe they never
even dated, just worked together or something. And their love evolved into a
nice little warm feeling. You know, that special kind of friendship. Like, they
will always have room for one another in their hearts, but not with any
intention of ever being together."

"I know exactly what you mean," she said and smiled. He smiled. The sweater kept
being green. Without a hint of anything dark under the surface.
