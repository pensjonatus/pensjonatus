The good guy fled and the bad guys followed. Well, he was good relative to the
bad guys at least.

The last anyone ever saw the good guy was in a town on the edge of a dark
forest. He had a backpack on, and a worn baseball cap. He headed down a shadowy
trail. I was told the same thing by the owner of the general store and by
several townspeople who happened to be in the square.

The bad guys arrived in a rickety old car. They asked questions sharply,
demanding answers. They got their answers, because nobody wanted trouble.
Especially not from the main bad guy, who was skinny and raggedy and cruel. The
bad guys followed the good guy into the black.

I imagine this is what happened: the good guy trekked across the dale and up the
mountain. He arrived at the abandoned school that has not seen children since,
you know, the incident. He knew he could not hide there, but he was tired of
running. So he made his last stand.

He wasn't able to defeat any of the bad guys, and they took what they wanted
from him. I imagine it wasn't just revenge. Revenge does not pay enough to
justify a long chase. Not even to very evil people. I imagine it was something
that was useful, so useful, and it's a shame the bad guys got it.

They emerged from the woods late at night, probably, and they got into their
rickety old car, and they drove away. The good guy was never found. But without
the thing they took, he was no longer a good guy. In fact, he was of no
consequence.
