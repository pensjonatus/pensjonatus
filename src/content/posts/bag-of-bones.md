I was nervous before going to the party, mostly because of the movies. See, in
the movies, people drink a lot, there's like drinking games and all that stuff,
and people hook up. And I was a virgin. I did not want to lose my virginity at
some stinky mean old party.

Luckily, it turned out not to be so bad. There was music and drinking, and some
people were dancing (I hate dancing even more than I hate drinking), but it was
also kind of dull and you could talk to people too. There was this interesting
girl there and we talked about Battlestar Galactica.

Then I saw this other girl, who had a nice body and a nice smile, and I bet she
would be nice if it wasn't for peer pressure that made her conform. You have to
conform if you want to be popular. I could never do that, that's why I'm such a
loner. I just don't fit in with regular society, with their sports and reality
TV.

The girl had real blue eyes, like people used to have in the old days, and I
liked it a lot. I wanted to look into those eyes and let her know there was
paradise on this world and I could give it to her. I had it all figured out and
when I finally decided to have sex, it would be really good for the girl,
because I thought about it a lot and I know what girls REALLY like.

But she kept ignoring me, so all I could do was pretend like our shadows were
kissing. For now.
