If you are reading this after I am dead, know I am not up there somewhere
looking down on you. I am not on my knees worshiping the Lord. I am not in
Heaven, eternally in bliss.

I am not in hell either, tormented by demons, of my separation from the creator.

I was alive and experienced great joy and great sorrow. But then I died and my
whole self was extinguished.

I knew love, in that grey room with the rain outside, but warmth within. I was
at peace sometimes. I was useless most of the time, as are we all.

I was not precious and worth preserving. I was not unique and valuable. I was
just a realization of physical processes, and I lasted as long as I needed to
last. Not a moment longer.
