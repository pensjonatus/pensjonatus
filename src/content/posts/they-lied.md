We were on a spaceship from the Belt to Mars. We were waiting in line for the
washroom, when Jim said:

"It's not real, you know."

"What's not real?"

"Planets and all that. It's not real. It's made up. It's a conspiracy."

"Huh? What makes you say that? I mean, we can just look outside and see them."

"Those aren't windows," Jim snickered, "Those are screens, man. They show you
what they want you to believe. Planets." He shook his head in disbelief.

"Why would they do this?" I asked.

"Big business keeping the little guy down. They want us to work so they tell us
they ship us around the solar system. In reality, we're in a compound. A big
one. On Earth."

"Yeah, but why? Wouldn't they make us work if we were on Earth?"

"No, man. Earth is a paradise. It's perfect. There's no work there. Robots do
all the work."

"So why do they make us work? Robots could do all the work."

"Because, Mark. Because they want to make us stupid and then divide us."

"What's so stupid about planets, Jim?"

"You would fall off into space."

"No you wouldn't."

"Why not?"

"Because if gravity," I said.

"Let me ask you one thing, though. Are you a scientist? What do you know about
gravity?"

I paused for a second to think this through. Jim was making a good some great
points, so I decided to give his theory a chance. But it was already our turn
for the washroom.
