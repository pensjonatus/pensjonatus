It was dark and stuffy there. My wife thinks there was a giant boiler just
outside the wall and I think she's right, even though we could not see it. We
heard a humming.

The light was the heavy type of red, and it made everything seem red. I think
the carpet might have been red all along, just like the carpet we have in our
living room, but I'm only speculating.

The place made my wife different. She was all over me. We kissed for the first
time in a while and she seemed so happy. But I think I was too eager and she
told me to hold my horses. She wanted to bask in the place and the redness. I
let her, I hung back.

We did not get enough time in the room. I am sorry I did not get to explore the
doorways that were in the room, but my wife said they might lead deeper into the
place and maybe there was no going back. I love my wife so much, but I wanted to
go back to normal life.

And we did. But I will tell you about the other times we went into the place and
what we learned there. But most of all, who we met there and what that led to.
