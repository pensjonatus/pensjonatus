They put me on the table to do the lethal injection. They strapped my arms and
legs in. My mouth was dry, like there was something stressful ahead.

The priest said a prayer, and I though that it would really be something if Baby
Jesus was real. But then I thought Hell would be real as well, and I would be on
my way there. I would have something to be stressed about.

The nurse stuck the needle in and then put the sticky thing on to keep it in
place. She brushed the skin with her glove, ever so gently. Her hand was warm.
Such a nice feeling, patients must love her touch.
