Two ageless women were sitting across from me on the train. As soon as they got
on, one picked up a book and the other put her headphones on to listen to music.
They spent most of their trip like that, exchanging smiles every once in a
while.

I could not tell what their relationship was, were they friends, a couple,
mother and daughter, sisters? At one point, the one that was reading the book
got a phone call. As she answered it, she passed the book to the other one who
started reading it immediately. She read it for a few minutes, and then put it
in her bag. She nodded at the other woman and they got ready to get off the
train.

They said goodbye to me before they left. I wondered if they kenw each other's
thoughts. And did they know mine? And did I know theirs?
