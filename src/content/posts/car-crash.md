Jacob saw somebody get hit by a car every day since he was ten. The first one was his mother. She was walking across the parking lot of a shopping mall when an SUV ran her over. Jacob was in therapy for years.

A study has shown that car crashes are extremely erotic. People sometimes climax when their vehicle collides with another or with a massive obstacle.

One scientist took interest in Jacob's strange condition. He studied the statistical probability of the phenomenon, but he gave up. It did not make any sense to continue. The scientist is now living a life of seclusion, and he took to religion.

Jacob does not even flinch when it happens anymore. Ninety-five per cent of the time his only thought is that the other half of the day is about to begin.
