I am on a date with Tara. Some people do not have much to say, so they just talk
about themselves, and I can clearly see Tara is that kind of person. And when
she is not talking about herself, she is talking about something so
insignificant, inconsequential, or boring, that it turns out even worse. She is
not a bad person, she is just extremely dull.

I know saying that does not make me look good. I mean, who am I to judge another
person? But guess what, I am the same. I want to talk about myself and I want to
talk about insignificant shit, and she is taking that time away from me. I am
too polite to interrupt.

So we sit. A romantic restaurant, the light reflects so nicely off of her long
earrings, her dark eyes shine so strong. She is a goddess to look at, and her
voice is beautiful, but it is still a chore to listen to her. So we sit at our
fiftieth-or-so date and I am pondering the future of our relationship.

And then she dives into a tirade about the drapes or the crepes, or something
else of no consequence. I imagine a dark place where she does not exist. It is a
safe and cozy place.

"No," I say all of a sudden and I get up. Her eyes become as big as the orbit of
Saturn.
