Emily was still recovering from the orgasm, it only just reached her that Zack's
arms were around her. She smiled and turned her head backwards to give him a
kiss.

She wanted some pillowtalk.

"Whatcha thinking?"

"I dunno," he sounded like he had dozed off. "About you. You're wonderful."

"Nah," she said, everything about her smiling.

Zack murmurred something she did not understand.

"What's your," she paused, "What's your secret fantasy?"

"That was it," he said.

"Oh come on. You can tell me."

"Hey, I just want sensual sex with the woman I love. Is that so weird."

"I know you have fantasies, Zack. All guys have fantasies. I have them too."

"Oh yeah, and what are they, Millie?"

"Uh-uh. I asked you first," Emily laughed a little.

"Well, I'm just not the kind of guy to have weird fantasies. I sometimes just
think of you."

"Liar."

"Nuh-uh."

"Really?" She did not know whether to feel flattered, but she did anyway.

"Yeah. Sometimes, when we're apart for a long time, like I'm on a business trip
or something-"

"So you never imagine yourself, let's say, with two women?"

"Nah, that's not for me. Why? Do you _want_ to be one of two women?"

"I know you want two women. Say: me and that girl from work you like," she said.

"I only want you."

Was he not letting himself be lured out? Or was he really such a good guy? Emily
let him drift away to sleep and sunk in his warmth. She liked the way he touched
her. Only she started to feel that somewhere ahead there was a small room. A
small, stuffy bedroom with the two of them trapped together. Trapped in long,
boring sex.
