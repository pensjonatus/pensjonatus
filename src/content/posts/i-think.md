I think they just said on TV that there is a zombie invasion. What do you call
one of these? A zombie apocalypse.

Nah, that's too crazy, I'm sure it's not true. I don't think they really said
that. That would be insane. Wouldn't it?

No, I think my girl broke up with me. I can't remember her name. What was it? Do
I really have a girlfriend?

So I stepped out and it was raining. People in the suburbs don't do rain, so
they were all inside, I had the street to myself. I walked down a bit, it was
kinda spooky, nobody around. I tried to remember if they actually said it was a
zombie invasion. I think they did.

Then I saw Dexter standing under a tree, his hood on, tiny dog on a leash.

"Hey Dex," I said, "Whatcha doin', dawg?"

"Nuthin'," he said, "I be walkin' my mah's dog."

"Foe real, foe real" I said, "You got any of that good stuff,
you-know'am'sayin'? That real good stuff?"

"Dawg," he said, "I just gave you the good stuff. You went home to do it. Mike,
are you okay?"

"Foe show, foe show," I said, trying to think. I think they said on TV my girl
broke up with me. Or was it something about zombies?
