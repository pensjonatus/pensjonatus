A traveler came into the tea house. It was late, dark outside, but cozy and warm
inside, so no surprise he wanted to come and join us. He brought a little bit of
the wind and chill and rain with him, but the warmth and the yellow lights soon
digested all the cold. Meanwhile, the traveler ordered his tea and scones and
was sitting comfortably. He removed the shawl and mask, and we all saw a
weathered face, a truly rugged man in his fifties. Pale blue eyes of some
intelligence and a capricious smirk.

He made small talk with the other patrons. And when asked about news of the
outside world, he said:

"I came through the gorge at the base of the mountain. In the the village at the
mouth of the gorge, I learned of some disturbing news. A baby was born with
sharp teeth and sharp claws. When left for a little bit, it became hungry and
tore at its own flesh. They found it dead, half self-devoured. A truly horrid
sight, I am told, and everyone I spoke to seemed upset. I moved on as quickly as
I could. Didn't want to dwell too long in a place like that."

"What of the mother?" someone asked.

"I did not inquire, why?"

"What made you leave so soon," asked another, "Were you afraid the birth was
caused by some sort of disease? Afraid you might catch it?"

"In a sense," said the traveler, "But not a typical disease cause by bacteria or
viruses. Not the kind a ointment might cure."

"What then?"

"A societal disease. Where the individual cannot be trusted not to harm
themselves. It is a soft and weak people that births such a child," he said,
"Why, in my day, we had to work hard for everything and that made us stable and
strong. And thoughtful, yes, thoughtful most of all," he nodded a few times, as
if affirming the result of his self-exploration.

"Was it not up to the Creator," said somebody, "To shape the child in the
mother's womb?"

The traveler seemed startled. "Why, I had not considered that. Do you think the
Creator is punishing them for their complacency? For their warm beds and full
bellies?"

"I don't think the Creator is like that," said somebody, "I think the Creator is
good and kind."

"Yes," said somebody else, "But the Creator leaves us free will. I believe it is
noble for people to build up a good strong economy so that they can live
comfortably. I think that shows resolve and intelligence. But when they allow
themselves to to stray from the dogma, well, their own flesh becomes corrupted.
Not of any decree from the Creator, but simply because of laws of nature. Tell
me, traveler, you did not enquire about the mother, but also, nobody volunteered
any information?"

"No," said the traveler, "They did not."

"Perhaps because it was a shameful matter," continued the patron, "Perhaps there
was no mother, but the baby came from an illicit relationship between two men.
That is the quickest way to corrupt the flesh."

"Ley me disagree," said another patron, "Because I think this is something far
more mundane. You see, the fish processing plant up the river has been dumping
their sewage back into the same river. They poisoned the water supply, causing
biological mutations. They are the ones to blame. Negligent, incompetent. The
plant is due for a change in management, I tell you."

"A change in management won't help!" bellowed another patron, "Why, it would
just be musical chairs among those inbred idiots. The people of the Plains are
greedy and mediocre. As long as they hold all the money, the economy will get
worse and worse," and then he added, "And the environment as well."

"Well, I am glad," said the traveler, "That we have tea houses like this one
where thought can flow freely and people can express their opinions. It has been
a pleasure speaking to you all, but my cup is empty and it is time for me to get
out into the world again and find accommodations for the night. I am a man of
action, you know, more than I am a man of words."

After the door closed behind him, I picked up his dirty dishes. I had to replace
the tablecloth because he had left tea and grease stains everywhere.
