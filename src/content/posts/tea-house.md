A traveler came into the tea house. It was late, dark outside, but cozy and warm inside, so no surprise he wanted to come and join us. He brought a little bit of the wind and chill and rain with him, but the warmth and the yellow lights soon digested all the cold. Meanwhile, the traveler ordered his tea and scones and was sitting comfortably. He removed the shawl and mask, and we all saw a weathered face, a truly rugged man in his fifties. Pale blue eyes of some intelligence and a capricious smirk.

He made small talk with the other patrons. And when asked about news of the outside world, he said:

"I came through the gorge at the base of the mountain. In the the village at the mouth of the gorge, I learned of some disturbing news. A baby was born with sharp teeth and sharp claws. When left for a little bit, it became hungry and tore at its own flesh. They found it dead, half self-devoured. A truly horrid sight, I am told, and everyone I spoke to seemed upset. I moved on as quickly as I could. Didn't want to dwell too long in a place like that."

"What of the mother?" someone asked.

"I did not inquire, why?"

"What made you leave so soon," asked another, "Were you afraid the birth was caused by some sort of disease? Afraid you might catch it?"

"In a sense," said the traveler, "But not a typical disease cause by bacteria or viruses. Not the kind a ointment might cure."

"What then?"

"A societal disease. Where the individual cannot be trusted not to harm themselves. It is a soft and weak people that births such a child," he said, "Why, in my day, we had to work hard for everything and that made us stable and strong. And thoughtful, yes, thoughtful most of all," he nodded a few times, as if affirming the result of his self-exploration.

"Was it not up to the Creator," said somebody, "To shape the child in the mother's womb?"

The traveler seemed startled. "Why, I had not considered that. Do you think the Creator is punishing them for their complacency? For their warm beds and full bellies?"

"I don't think the Creator is like that," said somebody, "I think the Creator is good and kind."

"Yes," said somebody else, "But the Creator leaves us free will. I believe it is noble for people to build up a good strong economy so that they can live comfortably. I think that shows resolve and intelligence. But when they allow themselves to to stray from the dogma, well, their own flesh becomes corrupted. Not of any decree from the Creator, but simply because of laws of nature. Tell me, traveler, you did not enquire about the mother, but also, nobody volunteered any information?"

"No," said the traveler, "They did not."

"Perhaps because it was a shameful matter," continued the patron, "Perhaps there was no mother, but the baby came from an illicit relationship between two men. That is the quickest way to corrupt the flesh."

"Ley me disagree," said another patron, "Because I think this is something far more mundane. You see, the fish processing plant up the river has been dumping their sewage back into the same river. They poisoned the water supply, causing biological mutations. They are the ones to blame. Negligent, incompetent. The plant is due for a change in management, I tell you."

"A change in management won't help!" bellowed another patron, "Why, it would just be musical chairs among those inbred idiots. The people of the Plains are greedy and mediocre. As long as they hold all the money, the economy will get worse and worse," and then he added, "And the environment as well."

"Well, I am glad," said the traveler, "That we have tea houses like this one where thought can flow freely and people can express their opinions. It has been a pleasure speaking to you all, but my cup is empty and it is time for me to get out into the world again and find accommodations for the night. I am a man of action, you know, more than I am a man of words."

After the door closed behind him, I picked up his dirty dishes. I had to replace the tablecloth because he had left tea and grease stains everywhere.
