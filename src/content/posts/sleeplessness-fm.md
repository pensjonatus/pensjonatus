"Good evening, folks," he said into the microphone, "This is Jake O'Reilly, broadcasting live, all night through, on KBFM. If you know me, you know I cannot sleep on a night like this, so I come in a give you night owls something to listen to. Here's some music and then I will be back with an announcement."

As the music played, he was looking out the window on the parking lot. Only his car was there in the stale lamplight.

"That was Fleetwood Mac and this is Jake O'Reilly with KBFM news. Last night some kids desecrated the Red Rose Cemetery. Apparently, they destroyed several gravestones and dug up some graves. They also broke open the Henderson family crypt. The sheriff's department is looking for any witnesses, so if you happened to drive by there and saw anything, give them a call at 911."

He adjusted himself in the seat.

"You know, it pushes my buttons," he said, "How kids today are turning into such monsters. Isn't it scary? When I was in high school, I already had a job and I was too tired to party at the graveyard. I was thinking about my future, not about drugs and alcohol. They act like they lost their brains somewhere."

He realized his tone had become harsh.

"Would you listen to me? I sound like my old man. Okay, these kids committed a felony, but there's no need to bash all kids for it. There are decent, hard-working young people out there and a group of punks should not skew the image for us. And let me tell you what I read about folks; IQs are getting higher and higher every generation. There was a study of the tests, the IQ tests they have been giving people for years, and the average results are higher than they used to be. I mean, they are bound to be, with all the computers and other gadgets. I mean, I don;t even know what half of the stuff is for."

He noticed out of the corner of his eye that something moved in the parking lot, but he was too late to catch it.

"If you let an old man ramble for a second, I will tell you what all of this is about. The rage you see in some older people, like myself. The indignation. It is not about the world outside.  You will hear there are more wars now, more gay people, more pedophiles, more violence in the streets. Well, I don't think that is true. I mean, sometimes, bile builds up in me and I feel that is true, but my brain tells me those things are more or less the same they used to be. If anything, they are better. When people like me get angry and start complaining, it's not about what's around, it's about what's inside. Yeah, you heard me right. I complain about what's inside me."

He paused to take a sip of coffee.

"Take my sleeplessness for example. I'm fine now, but during the day, I keep dozing off and I feel like crap. But even if you sleep right, you're still a mess. I mean, your muscles wane away and you get all flabby, your hands shake, your hair falls out, your eyes get worse. You start to feel powerless and, what is even worse, useless. So, you lash out."

He paused to take a sip.

"Sorry for the depressing topic, folks. How about some music and then I will take a call, if anybody's out there."

Something definitely moved in the parking lot. It was like a man, but when Jake zeroed in on him, he was gone. Then the light on the phone blinked and pulled his attention away. He  faded the music out.

"Looks like we have a caller," he pushed a button, "This is KBFM and you're on air. Who is this calling?"

"Hi Jake, this is Mike Lewatsky."

"Hey Mike, how are you doing this evening?"

"Not so bad, not so bad. I was just listening to you and I gotta say I agree on some things. And on some... not so much."

"Go ahead, Mike."

"I know the feeling of getting weaker. I used to be able to lift a cement bag, you know, one of those big ones, or maybe even two. Now, I can't hardly lift a shovel. But on the other hand, kids are going crazy these days. I mean legalize marijuana?"

Mike went on, but Jake could not focus. He was looking out into the parking lot and could see a person standing on the edge of it. The silhouette was grey and jagged, he could not quite make himself look straight at it, as if his eyes slipped off, but it was definitely there. And somehow, he had a feeling it was not friendly.

He realized there was silence on the air.

"Aaah, thanks Mike," he said without knowing what the man had just said, "I appreciate you taking the time to make the call. Why don't we listen to another tune."

He put some music on and walked up to the window. The dark person was still there and Jake thought it was probably death come to collect him. He felt a chill go down his spine and realized he was not ready to die. Granted, life was harder and he was not so proud of himself anymore, but he wanted to live more.

Then more people walked into the parking lot and he could see he was wrong about the figure. It was not death, and neither were the others. They were too physical for that, too carnal. The rotting flesh was coming off their faces, their mouths were open and asking for sustenance in grunts and growls. They were the dead and this was the end of humanity.

Jake whimpered.
