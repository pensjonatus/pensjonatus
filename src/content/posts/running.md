I went out to have breakfast with my friend Todd. We lived in a walk-around
neighborhood, so we walked to the restaurant. On the way there, a guy jogged by
us.

"You know," said Todd, "A man running this fast is bound to be running from
something."

I did not laugh.

"But," Todd continued, "No matter how fast you run, you can't run from
yourself."

I gave Todd an evil look, trying to communicate all my anger to him. "Very
funny, Todd. Very... veeeery funny."Â He knew I was considering opening a bakery.
And later _running_ it. "Very funny, Todd."

Todd was an evil man.
