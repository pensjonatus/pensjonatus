Every schoolchild knows the basics of cosmology. The world exists in the corpse
of a dead angel. Everything that is will die and become a spirit. Spirits spend
millennia developing to become angels. Eventually, the Age of Reason comes when
angels live in harmony for millions of years. Alas, the Age of Brutality must
come when angels fight and devour one another until there is only one left.
eventually, he also dies, but as his soul leaves his body, it becomes a bright
shining God who creates everything that exists.

Now, seldom does a schoolchild ask the following question: how does the Age of
Brutality come about? Are angels not highly developed beings with ages upon ages
of growth and harmony behind them? True, old angels are, but as the universe
grows older, everything that exists must die and grow to become an angel as
well. That includes rocks and trees, and planets and suns, and galaxies and
black holes. There are empty, mindless things in this universe that exist only
to devour and expand. They cause the great war.

Remember this lesson, it will serve you good when the exam comes. Until next
time, children.
