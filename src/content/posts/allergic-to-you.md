My skin itches, my nose is runny, and I cough. When you are near me. I cannot explain it any other way. I am allergic to you.

Back in school, I wasn't. We hung out all the time and when you weren't around, I always thought I could almost see you.

I wasn't allergic when we met again two months ago, after 10 years. You like my face and you said I have grown up.

I cannot stand you now.
