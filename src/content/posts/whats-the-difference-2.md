Have you seen that Australian version of Alien? They say it’s exactly the same
as the original.

Some people put the two on a couple of screens side by side. They watched it and
rewatched it. They could not find a single difference.

Some scientist put it into a computer, did a frame-by-frame comparison, and come
up with nothing. Or maybe it was just a kid in his bedroom? I think they should
compare the audio as well.

What’s the point of making the move again if it’s exactly the same? They say
it’s pixel perfect. Can you see the point? I sure can’t.
