Have you seen that Australian version of Alien? They say it’s exactly the same as the original.

Some people put the two on a couple of screens side by side. They watched it and rewatched it. They could not find a single difference.

Some scientist put it into a computer, did a frame-by-frame comparison, and come up with nothing. Or maybe it was just a kid in his bedroom? I think they should compare the audio as well.

What’s the point of making the move again if it’s exactly the same? They say it’s pixel perfect. Can you see the point? I sure can’t.
