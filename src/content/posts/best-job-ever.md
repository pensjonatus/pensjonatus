I got fired from a lot of jobs. I used to sell this brand of yogurt to shops,
but I got fired for pissing off the shop owners, whatever, they were idiots
anyway. And I used to work for at this tobacco shop, but all the customers were
idiots who didn't know anything about tobacco, so I would just cuss them out.
Whatever, no big deal.

And then I got this job at the Vatican (I'm Italian, by the way), and it's just
perfect.

There are these hallways in Vatican where tourists are not supposed to go
because they are like private chambers and everything. And there are signs that
say "No Tourists Allowed, No Admittance" with a little picture of a person
crossed out and a red rope across the hall, but I guess people are too stupid to
understand so they have to put a person in each of these places, and that's my
job. I'm the guy who tells these dumb fucks not to go there.

I like this job and I like my boss, Cardinal X. Whenever he goes down his
private hallway with a little boy or something, I nod and say hello, and he says
hello back. I guess he's a good guy, even though he's a real idiot.

Like that one time he passed me and we said hello, and then this old lady
followed him, and I said "Hey you dumb cow, can't you read? You cannot go there.
Lose some weight and get less old, please. Fuck you very much." She got all
angry about it, and my boss stopped in his hallway and looked back, but I could
tell from his stupid face he did not care, and he just continued on and
disappeared around a corner.

So anyway, I get accused of violence and bad conduct a lot, but I'm lucky the
Church doesn't care. I'm lucky to have this job and they're lucky to have me.
