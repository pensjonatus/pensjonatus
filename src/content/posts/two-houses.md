In California December sun, the house was getting ready for Christmas, but Jason
could not put all his heart into it. He kept thinking about his other house and
that other woman making sure everything was ready for this important day.

"Honey," Felicia yelled across the yard, "Could you run down to the store and
get some groceries? I made you a list."

"Sure," Jason said, coming down the ladder. He could hang up the lights later
but without the groceries she was held up. It was a rational request, but he was
still a little angry. As he got off the ladder, he looked at her. She was
wearing a red bandanna, what a nice Christmas color. Jason smiled a brilliant
smile and ran off to the grocery store (in his car).

He managed to get through the day without his growing irritation showing. They
had Christmas Eve dinner, put the kids to bed and and all that.

When Felicia was asleep, Jason got up and went down into the garage. He put his
red coat on and opened the magic portal. He stepped through it into the vast
workshop where elves were working on various toys. He looked across the shop
floor to Mrs. Claus, she smiled at him. She was wearing a red bandanna.
