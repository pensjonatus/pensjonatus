The actor was alone at home. He just got back from a meeting with his agent who
told him the actor would now work on the set of a major film that would bring
the actor even greater fame and millions of dollars. Also, the actor's new
singer girlfriend looked even better in real life than she did on screen. To top
it off, the queen herself would take time out of her busy schedule to knight the
actor the following week.

Yet somehow, the actor was not happy. He got up from the couch, took off his
fashionable scarf, then his designer sweater which he wore over nothing and
stood in front of a mirror, looking at his exposed torso. The chiseled chest,
the well-defined abs, and the bulging muscles were all staples of an actor. A
requirement, really, and one which had cost him a lot of work and even more
money. He stood there looking at himself and said:

"This is not me."

Then, the actor contemplated the unthinkable. His muscles tensed at the very
idea, but he could not get it out of his head. He knew his reptile brain would
not stop until it made the body do the act. Through repetition of fantasy, the
reptile part of his brain would finally ebb away his iron will and he would do
it. "

Why fight? Why not just give up?" he said.

The actor went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. It was empty, except for
one item he had procured in secret. A big fat muffin, rich in sugar, gluten, and
carbs beckoned him. And he heeded the call.

"You cannot stare into the abyss without the abyss looking back at you," he
mused, as he consumed the confectionery in front of the kitchen mirror.
