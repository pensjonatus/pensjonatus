He was a completely unimpressive man. Average looking, nothing special. Not muscular or fat, not handsome or ugly. He had a plain old job and was okay at it. He had some sense of humor, but not hilarious. He was not dumb but not bright either. He seemed to have no smell.

When she finally decided to sleep with him, she had to give him several hints before he realized it was time to act. She had to take his hand, and hold it in hers rubbing his fingers with her thumb. (His hand was not big, and it was not small either.) And then she had too look him in the eye, long and intense.

He was an average kisser. She thought this must be what the general motion of kissing is when it is not even put into practice, just theorized about. It was like reading about kissing in a magazine. She knew she was being kissed but felt nothing.

When she unbuttoned his shirt, she saw his chest for the first time. His rib cage was concave, ribs twistedÂ and bent like there had been a storm inside his body. She placed a kiss in the middle of the deepest depression, she ran her hands all over his skin, she started going crazy with desire. She felt an orgasm just outside the horizon, coming slowly towards her.
