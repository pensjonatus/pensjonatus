He was a completely unimpressive man. Average looking, nothing special. Not
muscular or fat, not handsome or ugly. He had a plain old job and was okay at
it. He had some sense of humor, but not hilarious. He was not dumb but not
bright either. He seemed to have no smell.

When she finally decided to sleep with him, she had to give him several hints
before he realized it was time to act. She had to take his hand, and hold it in
hers rubbing his fingers with her thumb. (His hand was not big, and it was not
small either.) And then she had too look him in the eye, long and intense.

He was an average kisser. She thought this must be what the general motion of
kissing is when it is not even put into practice, just theorized about. It was
like reading about kissing in a magazine. She knew she was being kissed but felt
nothing.

When she unbuttoned his shirt, she saw his chest for the first time. His rib
cage was concave, ribs twisted and bent like there had been a storm inside his
body. She placed a kiss in the middle of the deepest depression, she ran her
hands all over his skin, she started going crazy with desire. She felt an orgasm
just outside the horizon, coming slowly towards her.
