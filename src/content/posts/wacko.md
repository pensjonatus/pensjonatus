I was working security at a big office building. It was late, reception was about to close up for the day and pass over the desk to us when a man walked in from the street. He was wearing a suit just like everybody else around this neighborhood, but there was a big coffee stain on his jacket and his hair was a mess. He leaned over the front desk.

"Please," he said, "there is something wrong."Â I started walking towards him.

"What is it, sir?" the receptionist replied politely.

"It's the angels in my head. They won't stop screaming."

Then he went berserk. I had to put him in a headlock to get him out of here and hold him down until the ambulance arrived. Only later did I learn this was the day when God died.
