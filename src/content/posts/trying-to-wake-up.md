Munch, munch, munch, I was eating the meat they prepared for me. It was ground
beef which they fried in a pan and seasoned with salt. It was good and a lot of
it, but I would appreciate some vegetables and bread. Still, the two sisters
were really good to me to prepare the meal.

I was thirsty, having finished the ground beef, so they gave me a tumbler of
water. It was nice and cold, but a little salty. Still, I chugged it all down.
Gulp, gulp, gulp, it went down my pipe.

Then they took me to the bedroom, said I should rest. They stood across the
room, looking at me. The older put her arm around the younger in a caring
gesture. She looked so nurturing and the other one looked so safe and cozy. It
all felt like a dream: the cool house away from the desert sun and the two
sisters who were so good.

I felt mighty sleepy, and a little cold even, so I wrapped myself in the pink
blanket that smelled so nice it made the whole room smell nice. And I just
drifted into sleep. As I got all the way to dreamland, the room rocked, as if it
was trying to spill me onto a giant frying pan. Tilt, tilt, tilt, it went and I
fell, fell, fell.

I woke up to the heat, the dry salty air. I was in an abandoned gas station and
the sisters had taken both my arms. I tried to swear, but I remembered I could
notÂ speak since the accident.
