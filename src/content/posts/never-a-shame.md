It is always a shame when you are rejected, I thought as she started talking.

"I would love to, but I don't think this would be good for our friendship. I don't date guys from my circle of friends because I don't want it to get awkward later. You know, all of us going on a Christmas skiing trip or something and people go like 'Is Dave coming? And Felicia too? Well this is going to be... awkward.' You know what I mean? I just don't want that. I will talk to you tomorrow though, okay? I gotta go now."

It is never a shame to see a beautiful woman walk away, I thought and felt like a film noir detective. "See you around," I said, touching the rim of an invisible hat and smooth music began to play in my head.
