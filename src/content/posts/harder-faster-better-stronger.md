Hank was under the car, looking for the torque wrench, when he realized he
couldn't take it anymore.

"Why don't you turn that shit down, huh?"

"Yeah?" said Mike. "What do you want, Hank?"

"I said turn the radio down. This is not music. I can't think."

"Sorry," said Mike after the music got quieter. "I didn't realize."

"I mean, I understand rock. Alan Parsons Project, The Who, you know. But this is
just mindless noise. It doesn't go anywhere. What is it with kids these days?"

"Uhm, I think it's good. It's complex."

"What?"

"The music. It's instrumentally complex."

"Why is that important? Are you learning to play the instrument?"

"No."

"Even if you were, you're listening to it, not playing it. God, Mike, you're the
dumbest person I know. Would you change the station?"

"Yeah. Sure. Sorry, boss."
