The flickering light made the hospital room look ghastly and unfriendly. The
other patients had green faces, like the dead, and their gowns and sheets looked
like funeral cloth. Sarah was holding Jamie's hand. She did not
look appalled despite all the tubes stuck to it with tape.

"Jamie, why did you do it?" she said.

He was silent.

"You never take drugs. Not since I've known you. You're not the type. You don't
normally behave like those people."

He looked away. Remembered the rooftop party and the lights of the city.
Remembered the bitter taste.

"It's okay," she said, "I'm here with you."

"I know, Sarah. Thank you."

"Why did you do it?"

"Because I wanted to be cool."
