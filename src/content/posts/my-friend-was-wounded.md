My friend was badly wounded. My friend is my phone, actually, and the display glass cracked. This would never have happened in the future!

It was innocent enough, this whole adventure. I put my friend on the night stand before going to sleep and when I woke up the next morning, the glass was cracked!

It was a tiny little crack, but it still drove me crazy. It was like a blemish on every beautiful photo on Instagram and every single page of flash fiction I read, the white background and the black typography. Why did it have to crack?!

I got some reinforced tampered gorilla glass with no-stains-or-money-back-guarantee glue. It took me seven tries to put it on. SEVEN! But I finally did it. And I put my phone in a cool-looking case, to protect it even more.

But alas! There are tiny little hairs behind the glass and I can see them. And the case makes it look chubby and ugly.
