"Mom, I'm home," I said, like I used to when I got back from school. The house
was empty, no furniture except for some old cracked plastic chairs in the
corner. There were cobwebs in the windows. Bright July sun shone through.

I went out and circled aroundÂ back. Our old washer and dryer were still in the
laundry room, but now they were all rusted. I opened the washer hatch and
reached into its dark belly. I touched something hard cold and oblong. I pulled
it out. It was an empty milk bottle. "Strange," I mumbled.

I went back inside the house and got to the foot of the stairs. I tested the
first step, but it was most likely too weak to sustain my weight, so I stood
there, trying to decide.

"Ben," my wife had entered the house and was standing in the doorway, backlit by
the heavy sun, "Come on, can we get out of here? This old place gives me the
creeps."

"In a minute, honey. I want to see what's upstairs."

"Why? Did you leave something there?"

"No. Not really," I said.
