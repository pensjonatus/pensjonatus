Veronica was climbing up the stairs of her apartment building. Jeremy was not
home, he was working late that night, so she would have the apartment all to
herself. She was already thinking about the bubble bath and glass of wine.

"No, I'm listening, mom," she said into the phone, "And I agree, it is a
problem. I'm sorry I can't be there with you." She did not think it was a huge
problem, but she sympathized. "Yes, I will make sure."

She passed the girl who lived next door to them, who was also called Veronica.
The other Veronica was on her way downstairs to do the laundry. They exchanged
smiles.

The other Veronica was shorter than this Veronica, had really nice long hair,
and was also much prettier than this Veronica.

Veronica let herself into the apartment.

"No, mom, I just got home," she sat down on the couch and wiggled out of her
coat. "I just saw this girl, this other Veronica who lives next door to us.
She's a mean one. No, actually, she's not mean. I'm just... I guess I don't like
her. No reason."

She walked into the kitchen and got herself a glass of water.

"Yeah, I'm sure Jeremy is working late. What kind of a question is that? Mom, I
am sure. I am not jealous."

She bit her lower lip.

"I am more worried some skank is out to get him. I am not jealous."
