"Hey, so how's that feeder working out for you?"

"Pretty good. Why? Are you thinking of getting one too?"

"Maybe. Do you recommend it, though?"

"I do, yes. It's good."

"Is it good for the kids? Are your kids happy?"

"Yeah, they're happy."

"So it's in the room with them all the time?"

"Yes, all the time. I mean, there's no real way to get it out of there. I mean, considering the alternatives."

"And they can't leave the room either?"

"They can't. But why would they? They do school remotely. And anyway, what good is school to them when we have the feeder?"

"All right. All right. So, I know the price on the website, but what's the day-to-day cost?"

"It's, you know, the cost of meat to feed the feeder. It's like, I dunno. It's okay, I guess. It is what it is."

"What if you don't feed the feeder? Does that get it out of the room? If I wanted to change my mind about having one."

"I mean, yeah, maybe it would get it out. I don't know. But the kids, man. The feeder would it them. You can't leave it hungry. You have to feed the feeder."

"You HAVE to feed it?"

"You do. But, I mean, consider the alternatives. Show me a better alternative and I'd happily take it."
