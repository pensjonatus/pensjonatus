The doorbell. Annabelle waddled down the hall yelling "I'm coming." At the door,
she stopped and asked "Who is it?"

"Clancy's Groceries, for Ms. Lee," came the voice from the other side.

She opened the door. A young fellow with hair of blonde and big blue eyes was
holding three large paper bags full of produce and sundries.

"Come in," she said, "Can you set it down in the kitchen?"

"Yes, of course, ma'am," and so he did. "That will be forty-five dollars
and twelve cents."

She handed him a fifty, "Here you go. Keep the change."

"Thank you kindly, ma'am," and the boy left.
