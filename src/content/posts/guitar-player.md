Can you make a better first impression than when you walk down the street with a
guitar on your back. Say it is a rainy day and your longish hair is wet, but you
walk slowly, as if you did not care. You seem lost in thought, probably going
over lyrics or replaying a love encounter in your mind. You raise your eyes only
for a second to catch the chance look of a cute girl walking by. Life is good.

Then you walk on, thinking about meeting the girl again. She would say: "I
remember seeing you around, with your guitar. You probably don't remember me."

"I remember you," you would reply, and then smile, but give it a little extra
something, like a sad look of longing.

"So are you going to play anything tonight?"

"Maybe," you would say. And then when you play, you would make her move her head
slightly from side ot side. Life would be even better if that happened.
