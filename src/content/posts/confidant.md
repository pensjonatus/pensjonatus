"He is the strong type, a business shark, but also a real man," Dora said. "The
type of guy that would make me feel safe because of how strong he is. He is also
handsome."

He thought about his wife, whom he really loved and considered the perfect
woman, but he did not say anything because he knew Dora would lash out.

"But I just don't want another man in my life. I mean, they must pick up on some
vibes from me or something. I am in a relationship and I am happy. I don't want
to change anything."

He thought about how nobody had shown any interest in him for almost two decades
and thought she was just having one of those attractive people crises. But he
did not say anything because he knew Dora would lash out.

"Anyway," Dora said, "I'm glad we had this conversation. You are such a good
listener and probably the only man who understands me. Also, probably the only
man who is not trying to sleep with me."

Because you are ugly on the inside, he thought. But he did not say anything
because he knew Dora would find that extremely attractive.
