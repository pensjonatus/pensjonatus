I was in Amsterdam again. After the a day of client meetings, I took the tram to
the red light district. I selected a girl and went back to her place.

I stepped out of the shower and she was sitting on the bed. "What do you like,
honey?" she asked. She was tall, skinny and black. She did not look like my
Martha at all. Good.

I beckoned her with my finger. She got up and smiled without showing her teeth,
just like Martha sometimes did. But that was okay, focus on her, not Martha.

She spoke the language of the body, giving me studied hints that I was desired.
She was really good at it, I tore into her like I was 18 again. She moaned the
right way, the illusion was up the whole time. Up until she put her hand on the
back of my head which reminded me of Martha again. I came with a desperate rage.

When we got dressed, I waited at the door so she could collect her things and we
would both get back out there. As she buttoned up her coat, she asked: "Did you
like it, honey?"

"I did, thank you," and I gave her a hug. I couldn't stop my voice from
breaking. "You remind me of my dead wife."
