I had a friend named Monica once, who believed human brains were like radios in
that they emanated electromagnetic waves and could tune into electromagnetic
waves, which is to say: thoughts. So, she believed thoughts could travel,
essentially, from human skull to human skull. She got that idea from someone who
didn't know any better, and it sounded like something that makes sense, so she
believed it.

I never thought it made sense, even though I couldn't explain why. I can explain
why now, and that makes me sure that I was right all along.

But also, I was once lying next to a girl. We were both very sleepy and falling
asleep, and I wanted to say something, but I didn't have the energy. So I think
I dreamed or imagined my thoughts beamed into her skull, and she thought or
imagined she picked them up and understood me. And that's how we've communicated
for the thirty years we were married, sleepy or not.

Monica, on the other hand, died young. I hope she felt good in her belief in
radio brains, and I hope whatever it evolved into, it gave her mostly joy.
