"So, what's happening with Veronica?" he asked me.

We were having lunch at a seafood restaurant in a small seaside town. A tourist
spot, great for vacationers on a budget, and families who want to experience the
local color. Fish and crabs were mounted on the walls, along with some equipment
for catching and killing them. The staff wore hats that were probably the local
fisherman hats. The scent was clam chowder and lobster.

It was technically a business lunch.

"Veronica," I said, "You mean Veronica Dell?"

"Yeah, who else," he laughed.

"Yeah, I haven't seen her since college. Except on Facebook. Aren't you guys
friends on Facebook?"

He shook his head slightly, "Not anymore. So I was curious."

"You guys went out a couple of times, if I remember correctly."

"Yes. More than a couple. So, what's new with her?"

"Let me see," I leaned back in my chair, "I think she opened a bar with her
husband. Yeah, I remember a photo of the two of them behind a counter."

He nodded, lost in thought for a little bit. "Anything more recent."

"Not sure," I said, "Haven't really been paying attention."

He was an average-looking guy. Not fat, not thin, not very athletic. A three-day
stubble and hair that needed trimming. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except maybe
a sense of cold sadness.

"So," I changed the topic, "Excited for the project?"

He emerged out of deep thought, nodded, smiled: "Yeah, great to be working with
you."

"It's a small world," I said.

"Not small enough," he said.
