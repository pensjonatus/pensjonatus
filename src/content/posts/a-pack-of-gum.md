I was leaving the motel, locked the door, then wondered if I should have left it
open. Does not matter. I walked over the parking lot to the office and left the
key on the counter. I stepped outside, it started raining. A strange sight in
the desert, but it was one of the signs of the end coming. Few people apart from
me knew that this was the last day there would ever be.

I got into my car. The shotgun seat was empty now, she had left in such a hurry.
I would never see her again. Does not matter. I opened the glove compartment and
a pack of gum fell out. I leaned over to pick it up and saw that her shoes were
on the floorboard. I picked one of them up and put it to my nose to smell the
sweat and leather.

Above, the sky began to crack. I wondered what happens to love when the world
ends.
