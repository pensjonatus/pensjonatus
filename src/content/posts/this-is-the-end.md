The boy was sitting in alone in a car. It was night time, the middle of a half-empty parking lot. Nothing was coming up, except the shift at 6 a.m. the next morning.

He was waiting for his buddies to get out of Walmart with all the beers. So they can drive back to the cabin and get shitfaced. But for now, he was alone.

The radio was playing "The End" by The Doors.
