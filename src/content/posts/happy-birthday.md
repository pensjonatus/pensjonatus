Wei was in trouble. He was trying to pinch a sweet bun from a stand and the guy
saw him, screaming thief which caused some upstanding citizen to catch him. That
is Wei, somebody caught Wei. A man built like a powerhouse was holding him by
the scruff of his neck.

Wei was in this kind of situation before, and many times.

"You fucking punk, you think you can eat for free? Well I got a family too, and
_they_ need to eat."

"I got him for you, don't worry. We're taking this little piece of shit to the
police."

"Maybe," an old lady from the crowd shouted, "You should drown him in the river.
Like a stray cat."

A small poor man emerged out of the mass of people, his hair in disarray, his
clothes in need of mending, but clean, his dark eyes an island of peace in this
frantic adventure. Wei lowered his head in shame. The small man looked at the
vendor and spoke softly. "This boy is my son." Everybody became quiet, as if to
let him speak.

The man who was holding Wei faltered, almost ready to release the boy.

"He," the vendor spoke hesitantly, as if he was ashamed, "He stole from my
stand."

"Wei," the father spoke, "Why did you steal? That is not our way."

Wei wanted to apologize, but he felt too ashamed to speak.

"I will pay," the father produced a handful of coins.

When they were walking down to the docks, Wei dared not look at his father. He
knew he would not see tears, only disappointment. Finally, he gathered the
courage to speak.

"I am sorry, papa. I did not do it out of hunger. I am hungry all the time. I
did it out of rage. Other people enjoy sweets, why not us?"

The father stopped, knelt in front of the boy to look him in the eye. Wei saw
that he was not angry. "Remember this question you just asked me. Maybe one day
you will be able to answer. Then you will tell me."

"Will we be able to buy food today, papa? You paid this man a lot."

The father smiled, "Come on, boy, I have a surprise for you today. It is your
birthday after all."

They walked on. "But you don't have to do anything for my birthday, papa. I do
not deserve it. I bring only shame."

"No, you do not, boy. You know the lowest side of life, you know hunger, you
know fear, you know it is not always easy to chose between good and evil. But
most of all, you are ashamed when you do wrong, and that makes you a good man."

"A good man doe not do wrong," said Wei.

"Only in stories, Wei. This is life."

They turned left instead of right. "Are we not going home, papa?" Wei was
thinking of the little hovel they shared with a fisherman's family. It stunk of
fish and sweat.

"No son, we are not going there anymore."

They stopped on the edge of the pier and raised their heads to look at the
skyscrapers towering on the other side of the bay, the impossible city of lights
and warmth.

"This is where we are going today. This is where we will sleep."

A long black limo pulled up. A driver in a black uniform got out and bowed
politely.

"I don't understand, papa."

"Before you were born, my son, I was the richest man in Asia. But I knew you
would not learn the value of life if you were raised as the richest little boy
in Asia. So I left everything in the hands of my advisers and moved back to this
stinking slum, where I grew up."

Wei could see his father's calm face lighten up. His hair was still a mess, his
cheeks collapsed, his face pale, but his eyes were smiling.

"Today is your tenth birthday and it is time for us to return. I want you to see
the other side of life now. I hope you will make good use of the things you've
learned."

Wei felt his world was falling to pieces. The other side was vast and unknown.
If he had been any other boy, he might cry or become angry, but that was not his
way. He had faced so much fear in life, this was no different. He would find a
way to adapt.

So he nodded and said: "Let's go, papa."

The limo driver opened the door and watched the father and the son climb inside.
In both their faces he saw the exact same set of eyes showing calm
determination.
