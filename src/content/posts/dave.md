The apartment was empty. He threw his keys on the counter, right next to the
book and staggered into the living room. It was time to go to bed, all the good
boys were asleep. It was work tomorrow, if he could get himself into the uniform
ever again, in the back of that fast food joint, blowing life away for
disposable income. He was drunk as a Turkish saint but he was not happy, hence
the sense of inevitable doom.

He fell down on the couch and passed out. When he woke up, it was still night.
The lights were on in the kitchen. He forced himself to get up and scrambled
back to the counter. The book was there. The autobiography of Dave Mustaine. She
had left it.

Before she left? Or before she was blown to pieces by aliens? Which would be
better? He wept.
