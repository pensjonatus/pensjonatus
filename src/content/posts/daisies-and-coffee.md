Daisy took a sip of coffee and looked at Marcus with her big cow eyes. She
smiled and he smiled back.

"I like to drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep," she said, "So that my
dreams are really fast, like this." With her hand, she showed how fast she liked
her dreams to be.

Marcus smiled again. "Isn't that from that coffee and cigarettes movie?" he
asked.

She got angry for being caught, but tried to be cool. "It's a good movie," she
said.

"Daisy, try to make up your own stuff. Don't be copying movies all the time."

She pouted.
