"So what are we going to watch?" somebody said. We were all taking places on
three red couches a Manhattan apartment. I sat down with my girlfriend Becky, I
put my arm around her. Her skin was soft.

"It's called _My Secret Desire_. It's Woody Allen's latest."

I looked across the coffee table at Jenny. She smiled a brilliant smile.
Outside, it was a hot summer night.

"What are we watching tonight?" somebody asked as we were sitting down in the
living room of a Miami home. I sat close to my girlfriend Jenny and she gave me
a smooch on the cheek. I could feel her nimble energy as she did.

"_My Secret Desire_. It's my favorite Woody Allen movie."

I smiled at this girl Linda, as I imagined myself slipping her panties off.

"What's tonight's feast?" I asked as I took my seat next to my wife Linda. She
stiffened. We had a huge fight the night before.

"It's a Woody Allen oldie," said Tara.

"Let me guess the title," I said and I gave her a knowing smile. She looked back
at me and made a farting sound with her mouth. Outside the window, the moon set
into a sea of cliches.
