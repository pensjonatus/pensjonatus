I ran down the street, chased by the pale lights and fear. I turned a corner,
but there they were. Six of them, moving thanks to invisible strings,
frantically out of sync with human rhythm, familiar in their fleshiness, but
alien in their objectness.

I almost fall down doing a tumble thing to change direction and ran towards a
chain-link fence. They were closing in from all sides, those murder puppets with
knives and claws. Immobile faces, expressionless eyes, blank stares.

I climbed and tried not to look back. Finally, after and endless second, I was
on the other side. I fell to the tarmac, still warm from the day's sun, probably
will never be warm again. I scraped forward, clambered to get up and run
further, into the vacant parking lot.

They leaped over the fence aided by the invisible puppet masters and were almost
on me. I managed to break a door in and found myself in the dark. I continued
onwards into the blackness. I knew I could never be seen outside again. Luckily,
the building swallowed me without complaint.
