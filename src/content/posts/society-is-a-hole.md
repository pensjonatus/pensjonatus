"And the motherfucker cut me off. No blinkers, he just jumped lanes and cut me
off. He could've gotten me killed. People think they are good drivers, but they
aren't. They risk their own lives and they risk other people's."

The two men were talking over a meal

"Yeah, and they don't realize how they spoil someone's day. I mean, you're a
dick to one person, they go on and be dicks to ten people. And those be dicks to
ten people, and so on it goes."

The wind was cold and strong, it madeÂ the tents dance. The men tried to get
warmth from the blankets, but blankets are dead things, they cannot make you
warm.

"I wish we could focus more on the positives."

"Fuck, it's cold. Pardon my French."

"More on the positives, you know what I mean. Like this food."

"It stinks. I think it's expired."

"What's a good meal you remember?"

"Let me see. I was eating at a nice outdoors lunch place. I was having Cesar
salad. The lettuce was nice and crisp, the chicken was soft and juicy. I was
waiting for my wife. She was getting back from an appointment with her eye
doctor. She appeared among the crowd, she waved at me."

"That's a nice memory."

"Yeah, the fucking lunch place is no longer there. They bombed the shit out of
it. They killed the owner with mustard gas. His wife and little baby are gone,
God knows where."

"Stop it, will you?"

"Sorry."

Soldiers were patrolling along the perimeter of the camp, they were wearing nice
warm jackets.

"This fucking climate is going to kill me."
