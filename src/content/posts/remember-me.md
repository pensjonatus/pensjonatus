She came to my book signing. I did not look up when it was her turn, I just said
"Who should I make it out to?"

"Daisy. Daisy Jones."

"Oh my God, Daisy. How have you been?"

We found ourselves at a coffee place, exchanging cliches. She wore her hair the
way I always liked it so many years ago. She was a bit older, but even more
beautiful. It took her a while to get to the point, though.

"You wrote about me."

I hung my head, then shook it. I was theatrical like that. "Yeah, I a... I hope
you don't mind."

"You wrote everything. The truth about me. About us. The way you left me because
you were bored."

"Now, you know that was not the reason."

"Yes. You think you did not put it in there, but it's there. You were just
bored, like a little boy bored with his toy. You went out there looking for
something and you found it."

I nodded. "Are you here to win me back by being a bitch?"

She laughed. I did not understand why.
