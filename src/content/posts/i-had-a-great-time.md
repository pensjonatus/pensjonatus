I walked her to the porch.

"Well, I had a great time," she said. "Will you call me?"

"Yeah," I said eagerly, "Yeah."

And then we stood awkwardly for a few seconds, and I was wondering whether I
should kiss her. Maybe on the cheek? When I saw somebody in the window, just for
a glimpse, before he let the curtain fall back into place. I think I saw a
lumberjack shirt and a lumberjack beard.

"Oh hey," I said casually, I think, "You live with a guy? Who is that? Your
roommate?"

She looked around, surprised, and then said: "Oh yeah. He is my brother. That's
my brother."

"Oh cool. So your brother moved here with you? From Seattle?"

"Yeah, he came a little later than me. We kind of figured it's cheap and
convenient to live together." She ended nodding several times.

Awkward silence again.

"So anyway," I said, "I'll call you." Then I leaned in for that kiss, but the
kind of flinched, so I aborted and just said "Good night."

When I was back in my car, I looked at the house again and I could see her in
the well-lit living room window. She joined her brother, and he put his arm
around her and kissed her in a husbandly way. Why would she lie?
