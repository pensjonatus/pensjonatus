Sarah just got off the phone about a new job. They liked her during the
interview and they would like to hire her. She was straight out of college and
this was going to be her first serious job. She poured herself a cup of coffee
and walked up to the window to look at the street below. There were no people at
the moment, only a handsome man in a charcoal suit.

Another time, Sarah was recovering after a bad breakup. She had been crying a
lot but finally she was able to get herself together. She poured herself a cup
of coffee and stood by the window to look outside. The street was empty, except
for that handsome man she sometimes saw, but he only jogged by.

This one other time, Sarah learned she was going to be a mother. Her husband was
really happy about it. He was on the phone, giving his mother the news. Sarah
poured herself a glass of orange juice, no coffee for her while she is pregnant,
and looked out the window. The street was empty except for that handsome man she
sometimes saw. He was standing on the sidewalk, looking up at her.
