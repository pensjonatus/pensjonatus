Ben rushed into the classroom last minute, just as sister Mary was closing the
door. He apologized and sat down. Prayer went smoothly, then homework, but when
they got to Bible reading, he knew he was in trouble.

"Benjamin," sister Mary called over the pious heads of all other twelve year
olds, "Where is your Bible?"

He stood up, looking humbly at his desk.

"Respond, please, young man. Where is your Bible?"

"I left it at the dorm, I mean dormitory, sister Mary."

She came closer, her habit making a rustling noise. He got ready to be hit, but
instead, she spoke: "That is all right, you can use mine. Now, everyone, open
Exodus, chapter 13. Mark, begin reading."

Sister Mary stayed with Ben as the other boy read aloud, indicating the line
with her ruler. He could smell her freshly-washed frock, a hint of pepper on her
breath, and the natural smell of a woman on a hot day. It made him sweat.
