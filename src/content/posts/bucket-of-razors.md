Somebody had left a bucket half-full of shaving razors back stage, the old-fashioned kind of razors that you open like a jack knife. I had a lot to do so I just rushed by the bucket a few times, but finally it caught my attention.

"Mikey, do you know who put this here?" I asked and he shrugged. I asked a few other people, but nobody knew.

"Jim," I said, "Do you know if they are doing a production of the Barber?"

"I don't think so," said Jim, "But they _are_ doing _Death of a Salesman_."

"Are there razors in it?"

"I don't know."

He left me alone with the bucket. Immobile, heavy, with razors that were neither new and shiny, nor old and rusty. I crouched by the bucket to take a closer look, but there was nothing more to it.
