"I know what you mean," said Dave, making it about him now, "I can't get a break with my boss. He is such an idiot and he thinks he is this business tycoon. He gives me all kinds of tasks and treats it like he is mentoring me. Like I am learning so much. Doing pointless projects is not teaching me anything. I wish I could make some decisions already."

"Oh, tell me about it," said Kate, making it about her now, "People do not listen to the kind of music I like and they feel like they are better than me. They are not better. We are all the same, and their music is shit."

"I know how you feel," said Shglorth, making it about itself now, "My mother was a homeless hippie and my father was a ghost. Because of my half-living half-dead nature, I am the key to opening Hell to this earthly realm, so all kinds of cultists have been kidnapping me since the day I was born. I am in my twentieth cult now. It is getting sooooooooo boooooooring."

"Ugh, I know," said Rajoon.
