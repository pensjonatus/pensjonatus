"I hate my life," said Becky, "Mark keeps talking about other women. He says
Deborah is so great, or that whore from his office, he keeps saying how good she
is at her job and how she should be promoted. Ugh!"

"I know what you mean," said Dave, making it about him now, "I can't get a break
with my boss. He is such an idiot and he thinks he is this business tycoon. He
gives me all kinds of tasks and treats it like he is mentoring me. Like I am
learning so much. Doing pointless projects is not teaching me anything. I wish I
could make some decisions already."

"Oh, tell me about it," said Kate, making it about her now, "People do not
listen to the kind of music I like and they feel like they are better than me.
They are not better. We are all the same, and their music is shit."

"I know how you feel," said Shglorth, making it about itself now, "My mother was
a homeless hippie and my father was a ghost. Because of my half-living half-dead
nature, I am the key to opening Hell to this earthly realm, so all kinds of
cultists have been kidnapping me since the day I was born. I am in my twentieth
cult now. It is getting sooooooooo boooooooring."

"Ugh, I know," said Rajoon.
