In the hallway on the way to my apartment, there were groceries in a paper bag. They were in the middle of the floor, I had to step over them. They were not near any particular door. Anyway, I did not have time to think about them, I had to feed my rats.

When I was leaving the next morning, the groceries were still there, only somebody kicked them up against the wall. An orange had rolled out of the bag.

They were still there the following night, but I had no time to give them a second thought because I had to feed my rats. The groceries were still there for many days. I bet eventually they became _gross_\-eries, heh, heh.

Anyway, when they were pretty old and stinky, I took two of my rats out to the hallway to take a look.

"What do you think?" I said.

"They look pretty old," said Hugo.

"Why would anybody leave their food outside like that?" said Benedict.

"Maybe it is poisoned," said Hugo and they both started sniffing.

"Should we have him eat some to see it if is poisoned?" said Benedict.

"Me?" I said.

"No, let's just leave it there," said Hugo, "We have plenty of food whenever we need it. He brings it. It would be a shame if something happened to him."

I petted Hugo, he was such a good rat, and so intelligent. We left the groceries there.

The next morning, the groceries were gone and there was an ambulance in front of the building. I did not have the time to check who it was for, though. I had to get to work.
