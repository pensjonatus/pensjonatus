When I was on the train a few years ago, I saw a girl steal a phone out of some
guy's pocket. I looked her straight in the eye. She returned a playful look, as
if she was proposing us to become partners in crime. I refused to smile back.
She finally gave in and put the phone back in the guy's pocket, pouting her
lips. I kept looking at her, trying to send her a look of reconciliation, a sign
of forgiveness, tell her it was okay now. But she never looked at me again. She
got off at the next station.

This morning I saw her again. It had been years, but somehow I recognized her
face almost instantly. She jumped onto the train last minute, as the door was
about to close. She was carrying a box full of stuff, like she was moving. She
was winded, but a look of relief appeared on her face. She was probably in a
hurry, very glad she caught the train. She sat down with the box in her lap. She
looked happy. I wondered how her life turned out.
