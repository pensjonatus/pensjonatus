I was standing in line for a coffee. There was a shabby lady in front of me.

"What will it me, ma'am?" said the barista.

"Last night a had a dream that somebody cared about me," she replied.

I felt really bad for her and I wanted to say that I care about her, but I
thought she would probably look at me dead-eyed for a second and then start
acting all crazy. So I just stood there in silence until it was my turn.

I took my coffee to a two-person booth by the window and tried to think about
work, but I kept thinking about the strange lady instead. I could have told her
I loved her, but she could have responded rejecting me. And that I could never
take.
