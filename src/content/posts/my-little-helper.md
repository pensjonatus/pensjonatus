"Like that one time, I was making myself a sandwich, and the voice said 'You
checked this butter a week ago, it's expired,' and I remembered that was right,
I checked the date again, and it really was expired, so I said 'Hey, thanks,'
and made no more of it."

Vanessa nodded. Inside her brain, the germ of an unnamed syndrome slithered into
