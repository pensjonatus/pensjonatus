"Hullo," I said into the receiver, "Is this the body horror clinic?"

"The Body Reformation Oversight Clinic, yes," said the young on the other side.
"Would you like to come in for a consultation?"

"The thing is," I said, "I can't really, you see. That's the problem I'm calling
about."

"Has the ruin begun?" she asked.

"Ruin?"

"Yes, sir. The three stages are ruin, realization, and rebirth," she said,
matter-of-factly. "Ruin is the transformation you undergo. We can guide you
through the process."

"Yes, I suppose the transformation has begun. Or, the ruin, as you said."

"You mentioned you cannot come in for the consultation, sir. Could you describe
the nature of your ruin?"

"Yes, well, this is rather embarrassing. My body started burrowing into the
ground overnight and it has grown into a a sort of inverted tower. I woke up
like this, actually."

"Could you clarify, sir? What do you mean by inverted tower?"

"Well, it's like a tower that goes into the ground. My bones make up the walls,
and pillars, and railings. They also form the spiral staircase in the center. My
skin lines the walls and covers doorways. It also hangs in flaps here and there,
like large flags and banners. To the sides of the tower, there are rooms with
organs. Fantastic organs."

"When did this start, sir?"

"I was okay yesterday, and then I woke up like this. It was my 40th birthday
yesterday, I don't know if that's connected. I don't know if this started
earlier, though. I have been feeling a little different for a while. Not myself,
you know?"

"I see, sir. I think we can help you."

"Help me? So you're saying the transformation can be reverted?"

"No sir, I'm afraid not. But we can slow the transformation down to give you
enough time for the realization to happen."

"And then the last stage? What did you say it was?"

"Rebirth, sir," she said coldly.

"Rebirth? You said rebirth, right? Does that mean I will be back to normal? Or
even better?"

"Rebirth is where you are awakened into your new life, sir. And your new
future."

"I see, thank you. I have to think about."

"We'll be here," she said, "We've always been here. You just have to find a way
to reach us. Have a nice day, sir. And enjoy your ruin, if you can."

"Thanks, you too."
