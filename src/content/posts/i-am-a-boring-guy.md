I happened to me in a shopping mall when I was on a business trip a million
light years from home. I stumbled into a food vendor's, weak and weary.

"Hi, I would like to get something to eat," I said, "But I left my wallet at the
space hotel."

"Not a problem, sir," said the service droid, "We accept and value unique human
memories. Would you like to use your memories as a currency. We will not take
them away, only make copies."

"Yes, please," I said into the emerald rod.

"Please stand by while I scan your brain. Thank you, unfortunately, all your
memories are already in our database. Please, come back if you get any new
ones."

I made a sod face, as was the custom back then, and walked away. I noticed the
person behind me in the line gave me a look. It was as if he/she was saying
"Your type should not leave home without a wallet."
