Bill was twenty-five that day when Mr. White, his former maths teacher, saw him riding a bicycle down Main Street.

"Well I'll be damned, what happened to your car, Billy?"

"Mr. White," Bill stopped, nodded a polite hello. "I had a little accident. I drank too much and I ran it into a ditch."

"How's your father doing?"

"He's got his good days. But we all think it's not going to be long before," Bill looked away as he said it.

"I'm sorry to hear that, Billy. And what about your brother? Is he all right running the store by himself?"

"Uhm, I gotta go, Mr. White. There's friends waiting for me."

"You gotta do what you gotta do," Mr. White nodded goodbye.

Bill rode on to the parking lot outside the diner. A few guys were sitting all over a pickup truck. They greeted him with laughs and taunts. He threw a few fucks out there for good measure.
