"Come one, Tom! Come on!"

The fathers were sitting on the bleachers watching little league baseball. One had his cap turned backwards. One was wearing a white polo shirt. One was slightly drunk.

"Yeah, Tom, go for the third base," screamed the polo. "No, stop there, stop there! Oh... fudgesickles."

"Relax, man," said the cap in a relaxed manner. "It's just a kids' game, let the kids have some fun."

The polo ignored his colleague's remark. He shouted at the umpire. "The kid did not even touch him. He was safe. Come on!"

"You did good, Mikey," shouted the cap.

The drunk was not saying anything.
