Gil and Deb were sitting at the bar, having some beers after work.

"Look at that waitress," said Gil, "I wouldn't mind..."

Deb's face turned into a mask of hatredÂ for a second, and then she said with
disbelief: "What? Her? I don't see it. Why do guys always say a girl looks nice
when she has big tits. Yeah, she has big tits, but all they are is huge and
gross. Can you imagine her in a few years? Forget about it." But then perhaps
Deb thought that was not cool, so she looked around for another waitress, "Now
that girl, you see that? She's pretty. She has those delicate features. And
don't think I dis every girl with big tits, see, this girl has nice firm breasts
too. Only they are not so in your face, you know what I mean?"

"Whatever," said Gil, "Forget it."

Then the first waitress approached, "Will there be anything else?"

"Well," Gil tried to act manly and nonchalant, "How about another round."
