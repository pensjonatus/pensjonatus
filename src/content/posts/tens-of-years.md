She was making dinner and she did not have a job for him. That was fine, he sat
on a kitchen stool and talked to her gently. She was a good listener, always had
been, and he talked about his day, but also about the news and about things from
the past that the news reminded him. She offered an insight from time to time
and he marveled at how to-the-point it was.

When he ran out of things to say, he just looked at her hands picking things up
and putting them down. Her hands were a little more wrinkly these days, a little
spotted, but they were the same hands he had always known. He could not remember
a time before those hands. His wife's hands. So full of grace. With things.
