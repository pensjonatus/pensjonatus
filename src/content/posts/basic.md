Basic pants have two legs, just like basic humans. But we never call them basic
humans, we just call them humans, and we don't have room for other humans in our
world. Maybe if they have one leg, or no legs, that's okay. Also, we don't call
them basic pants, we just call them pants.

So, where I come from, there are very few basic humans, and nobody thinks of
them as the baseline or the template. We just think of them as unmodified. Most
people have a different number of arms or legs or other members, and it's
beautiful. It's a beautiful land for everybody.

Mind you, they don't have additional limbs PHYSICALLY. I am not saying it's
pretend, but it's more metaphorical than anything else. I know this kid called
Phil who take too much juice and is really deep into the metaphor and he calls
them astral limbs. We use them for self-communication or for symbolic sex with
other. They are not good for work or for moving around.

I also know a basic girl called Veronica and she's very shy. She doesn't fit in
with us yet, but that will change. We welcome all.
