Basic pants have two legs, just like basic humans. But we never call them basic humans, we just call them humans, and we don't have room for other humans in our world. Maybe if they have one leg, or no legs, that's okay. Also, we don't call them basic pants, we just call them pants.

So, where I come from, there are very few basic humans, and nobody thinks of them as the baseline or the template. We just think of them as unmodified. Most people have a different number of arms or legs or other members, and it's beautiful. It's a beautiful land for everybody.

Mind you, they don't have additional limbs PHYSICALLY. I am not saying it's pretend, but it's more metaphorical than anything else. I know this kid called Phil who take too much juice and is really deep into the metaphor and he calls them astral limbs. We use them for self-communication or for symbolic sex with other. They are not good for work or for moving around.

I also know a basic girl called Veronica and she's very shy. She doesn't fit in with us yet, but that will change. We welcome all.
