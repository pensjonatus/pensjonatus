I was on the train to work, drinking a cup of coffee, when I got the text. My
brother said the test results were back and he had liver cancer. Again.

I typed "So sorry, bro, we'll get through this," but then I deleted it all. That
was not how we were, my brother and I.

"Sorry to hear that," I started, but then what?

"You're going to be alright" was a lie.

"I'll see you later today" would be inconvenient for me, and possibly for him
too.

Adding a sad face seemed a little too frivolous. Cancer is always serious
business.

If I finished at that, it would be only half a text. And too formal even for me.

The train stopped. I got up quickly, stepped down to the platform. The crowd
pushed me towards the stairs. No time to text. Will have to do it later.
