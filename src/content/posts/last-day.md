Friday was Jake's last day and he sent an email, inviting people to say goodbye
in his cube. Melly did not know Jake that well, but he was a colleague, so she
wentÂ over there. A few other people were there at the same time, saying how
sorry they are to see him leave and asking about the future. Melly just stood
there with them, nodding and smiling.

Then somebody hugged Jake, and others followed one by one. A simple hug and a
"Take care!" and Melly made nothing of it. Until it was her turn to do it.

There were sparks, there was a mini earthquake, there was definitely strong
chemistry. Melly got back to her cube blushed, thinking about Jake's body. She
kept thinking about him throughout the day and over the weekend. On Monday, she
was sure she was in love. On Tuesday, she was very happy and planned
communication with Jake. On Wednesday, she sent him a message on LinkedIn. On
Thursday, she became frustrated by his lack of response. On Friday morning, she
was heartbroken and depressed.

Friday was, accidentally, Mike's last day. Melly did not know him that well, but
he was a colleague, so she went over to his cube.
