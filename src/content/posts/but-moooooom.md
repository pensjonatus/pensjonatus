"But moooom, why do I have to go?" she said to the phone, "I don't like these
events, never did. In fact, I think nobody likes them, people just go because
they feel they should. It's just tradition."

She put the phone in the other hand, started looking for something in her purse.

"Besides, I don't really know anybody, so I won't have a good time. Mom, I know
it's not about having a good time, but shouldn't we at least try to have a good
time whenever we can? I mean, life is short, isn't it."

Then she started giggling.

"I know, I know. Whatever. But anyway, I have a job interview the day after. I
need to be in high spirits and this will just bring me down."

She found what she was looking for in her purse. It was gum. She stuffed a
handful into her mouth. She continued with her mouth full.

"Besides, I'm still alive. It's not *my*Â funeral. Why should _I_ go?"
