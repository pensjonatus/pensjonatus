I wish magic items were possible in life. Key items that move the plot forward,
or allow us to overcome obstacles. Like a magic knife all covered in runes that
can pierce dragon hide, or a potion that makes you float up to the windows of
some ancient library nobody has been able to enter for ages. I know what you are
going to say, I play too many video games. Read too many fantasy novels. My
girlfriends always says that.

Ex-girlfriend. I was up late sitting on the couch playing a video game, really
into it, when she came back from her office Christmas party. She was surprised
to see me. She was slightly drunk.

"Hey babe," she said, "You still up? I imagined you would be asleep when I got
home."

"Yeah, I'm almost done with the Valurian campaign," I told her. I always told
her stuff about my games, even though I had the feeling she would not care. She
was always kind and understanding. Always listened through. And she knew this
particular campaign was very difficult and very important to me.

We talked about nothings as she went in and out of the bathroom, brushing her
teeth and changing into her pajamas. Then she sat next to me on the couch. She
brushed my hair back. I hit pause and sat so I could face her. She was a little
drunk which meant this could be one of those rare occasions when she initiated
sex. But it was not.

She put her hands on my puny shoulders. "My sweet man," she said, "Do you see
yourself as a protagonist?"

"We are all protagonists of our lives," I said.

"I know. But if this was a movie, would you be the main character?"

"Perhaps if it was a Woody Allen movie," I said. She did not smile.

"Perhaps then?" she mused, "No, I don't think so. No, not really."

"Well then," I said.

"Well," she said, "I might be. Now, when I am still young and full of energy.
But I cannot be your wife and still be the main character."

"Wife? Whoa, baby, slow down," I tried to joke, but neither of us was in the
mood.

"I don't want to get stuck here."

"Stuck, huh? I get stuck all the time," I said, "In my games."

"In games, you say?"

"In games," I echoed like an automaton. It was over. The next couple of weeks of
us trying to save our relationship were perfunctory and uninspired. They were
just delaying the inevitable.

I wish magic items could advance the plots of our lives. I wish background
characters could level up to become protagonists.
