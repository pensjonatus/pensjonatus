It was hot, it was a an outdoor cafe, it was summer. Two man were drinking
coffee, looking at the girls walking by.

"We need to make a move on the Henderson account," said one, as a blonde passed
by.

"Agreed," said the other looking at a redhead, "But what strategy do we choose?"

"Aggressive."

"Ah."

"Most aggressive."

"I see."

"Are you listening."

"What? No. I mean yes. Why?"

"You seem distant. It didn't used to be like that."

"Oh."

"You used to care about business. You were different."

"Things change. People do too."

"You don't seem to care ever since... Ever since she left."

"She was too good for this company and you know it. She is making millions
selling whatever to you-know-who."

"I do... I do?"

"I don't know."

"Well?"

"Well what?"

"Well, do you want to make a move on the Henderson account?"

"I already told you I do."

"I do too."

They took a sip of coffee each. They sighed each. High above, a tiny blue bird
swirled in the air. Far away from them, and free. The bird would soon go on to
writing memoirs and expose them for who they really were.

A metaphorical bird, if you know what I mean.
