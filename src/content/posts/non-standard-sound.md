The best sound effects guy in town was called in. As he arrived, the director was pacing back and forth between his office window and his Zen garden. All around stood a host of concerned minions. The director lifted his head only for a second to acknowledge the legendary soundsman.

"Good, you're here. It's about my invasion movie."

"_The Invasion of Los Angeles_," the assistant director said helpfully.

"I've heard about the project," said the soundsman, "How's it coming along."

The director frowned in disapproval at the question, and then muttered: "I need a sound that will indicate a terrible, murderous creature is coming. The hunter of souls. The ravager of hope. The destroyer of worlds."

"Like a roar?"

"No, not a roar," the director roared, "Something more noble and refined. A machine sound."

"Like a transformers noise?" the soundsman took his phone out to play some samples.

"No! Something new."

"I have just the thing," said the soundsman and was just about to add something when a terrible screech filled everything, like the sound of brakes as the car is rolling over an infant's head. Just a heartbeat and it was gone, but everyone felt sick to their stomachs.

"That's it, that's perfect," said the director.

"I did not make the sound," said the soundsman and they all turned to the window to see what was blocking the sun.
