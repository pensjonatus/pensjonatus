There was a magic merry-go-round down by the pier when I was little. The man who
inspected your tickets and operated the levers always smelled of wine, but that
did not take away the magic of the ride.

Other kids used to say your wish would come true if you could sit on the red
horse and if it revolved more than twelve times. The man would usually shut it
off after ten or eleven times. I do not remember if I ever got more when sitting
on the red horse.

But I know Tom told us one day that his father wanted to leave them. We let him
sit on the red horse each time we rode. I do not remember if he ever got more
than twelve times either.
