I was having lunch with my girlfriend.

"You're always mean to me," she said. "Why do you always make fun of me?"

"I guess I am tired of you. Maybe we should take a break."

"Yeah, I need a break from you too," she said.

"Fine, then it's settled."

That night, she showed up at my place as if nothing really happened. She brought
a bottle of wine. I did sleep with her, but I could not help but wonder if she
thought I was kidding about taking that break.

Late at night, I was watching her sleep. She was like a warm little ball of
coziness.

"Oh, well," I said to myself.
