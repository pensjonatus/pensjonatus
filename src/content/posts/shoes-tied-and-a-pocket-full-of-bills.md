Josh was walking down the street, looking for something to do. There was a clothing store, so he went in to try a few things on. He liked himself in a red-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt, it looked goofy enough for him, so he bought it. He then went into a diner and ordered a cup of coffee. He looked through the paper.

"Maybe I should get a job?" he said out loud.

He picked an ad and called the number.

"When? Why, I can do it right now. Where are you guys? Okay, I'll be there in twenty minutes."

During the interview, he said all the right things and the interviewer did not care he came in dressed in a Hawaiian shirt. He got the job on the spot and was told to show up a 9 AM the next day. He nodded politely and said his goodbyes.

That night at his apartment he was bored, so he called some of his friends, told them to come over and bring more friends. Next thing he knew, it was a party. He was sitting in his backyard with a beer.

"What are the goals in this game?" he asked.

"I don't know," said his roommate's voice, "I guess you make your own goals."

"Pffff, dumb. Let's play Call of Duty."
