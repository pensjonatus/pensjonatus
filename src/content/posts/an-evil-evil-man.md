Emily was so lucky to be married to Lord Havisham. She was scared at first, when
mother told her she was to be betrothed. But then he arrived at their estate in
a brand new automobile, she was smitten. They were wed on a May day.

He was older, his hair was sprinkled with grey, and she was only fourteen. But
he was gentle enough to wait until the night of her fifteenth birthday before
deflowering her. He was the kindest of husbands and hardly ever caused her any
pain.

But when she was nineteen, she began to notice a frightening change in her
beloved husband. From time to time, he would snap at her. He was oftendays
irritated, locked himself in the study and did not speak to her, nor did he dine
with her on those gloomy days. He would make comments about her talking to
younger men, guests at their house as if he was jealous.

One day she saw him angry with one of the workers in the field. He screamed at
the poor fellow and then gave him a good thrashing. She was so terrified that
she ran back into the house and cried. She knew there and then her husband's
core had become corrupted because of lack of church-going and too much focus on
Money. He was no longer kind, not as kind as Hubert or Humphrey. She could no
longer see herself spending the rest of her life with him.

However, she could not imagine life without him. So she wept some more.
