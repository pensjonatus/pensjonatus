The hotel I worked at was huge but there were not many guests, I only had a few
rooms to clean, and the rest of the crew had a day off. I was walking down the
carpeted hallway, wondering if I would still be here if I knew the world was
ending. If I would still clean up those last few rooms.

I reached number 341, the next one on my list. There was general mess inside, so
it took me a few seconds to notice her. There was a woman in the bed, lying on
her stomach in the rumpled up sheets, her hair in disarray, her face with an
incredibly intense expression of exhaustion.

Did I feel I surge of desire when I saw her? So warm and full of life, so human.
I do not remember, but I know I turned back on tiptoe and left the room. I put
the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door knob for her.
