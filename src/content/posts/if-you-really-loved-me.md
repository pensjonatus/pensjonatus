The car pulled up, but he did not get out. She opened her own door. When they
got to the theater, he let her pay for the tickets and did not offer to buy the
pop corn. After the movie, he groped her in the car and tried to make her give
him a blowjob.

When she finally got home, she prepared for bed, but had a hard time falling
asleep. She just lay there with her eyes wide open, staring at the window-shaped
light stain on the ceiling. Her thoughts were like a mountain spring, ever
moving, painfully clear, and cold, cold, cold.

She got up and went to the fridge to get a midnight snack, but nothing was good,
so she only took some cheese. She then sat on the couch in front of the TV but
did not turn it on because she did not want to hear human voice. She sat there
for a while, until the cheese ran out.

If aliens attacked, or zombies, would he save her, or look only after himself?
Would he be the hero then? Was his rough nature and animal spirit a sign of
great strength? Or was he just a spoiled momma's boy?

She decided she deserved some good food and picked up the phone to call that
24-hour Korean place. But then she thought about her figure and decided to go
back to bed instead.
