I meet all sorts of people in my line of work, and I have conversations with them. That is my job, basically. I ask them what they do and I hope they ask me what I do. I do it to promote a brand. No big deal.

I met a man in Prague who told me about a church he goes to.

"No, it's not really a church. These are meetings. We investigate," he said.

"What do you investigate?"

"We try to figure out who the players are."

"Aaaaah," I nodded, and then: "What players?"

He picked up an apple from the table. "This whole thing, this, this, and this. This is not real. It's a game. It's a hyper-realistic game and we're AIs in the game."

"Huh," I said, making a face as if I was thinking "I hadn't thought of that, but it makes sense."

"Think about it. You having a life, hobbies, a schedule, it makes for a more realistic setting for the game. If you fall in love with a girl and one of the players happens to be there when she is killed, that would make for a heart-wrenching scene. Really immersive." He smiled at the efficiency he was able to drive the argument home.

"So," I said, "I wouldn't be able to tell if I was in a simulation, would I?"

"Not a chance. This would be the only reality you ever knew."

"And who are the players?"

"The people whose lives are interesting. Action heroes, leaders, explorers, scientists, celebrities."

"Huh," made the same expression again, "And why do you try to figure out who they are?"

"We want to get them to admit," he said, getting up close in my face, "To admit they are playing the game. See, some have already admitted to some people, but we don't have any evidence. Although, we do know quite a lot. We know the game engine is called Omega 7 and it's the latest generation up in the real universe. We know that the Quellani want the engine shut down and that would be the end of everything. We also know the Telleri are avid players and they treat the game as more than entertainment. They believe the game can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. They believe the game to be a realization of the Absolute. We wish we could get to meet one of the Telleri. They would surely help us."

I did not ask "And then what" but smiled and said "Wow, I would love to hear some of the results. Do you guys have a blog or something?"

He sat back, as if offended, looked away. One of those situations where they do not ask you what you do.
