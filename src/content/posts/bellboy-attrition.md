He opened the door and carried the bags in. Then he turned around, but the guest
was not there. He stepped into the corridor, but it was empty.

He took the elevator all the way down into the lobby and saw the desk was
unmanned. He looked in the back room, but that was also empty. He went into the
hotel bar, but there was no bartender and no guests. He looked into his phone -
his contact list was empty.

"What is going on here?" he said to himself, "Has everyone disappeared?"

He stepped outside and saw the majesty of the wilderness; the forest was primal
and ancient, the mountain was immovable and dominating. He gasped at the
entirety of it all, he ventilated, he sighed, he hyperventilated, he dropped
dead.

A bunch of aethereal kids came over to prance about and frolic near his body,
and they sang this song:

> Toora Loora Teeda Tar
>
> Bellboy, bellboy, where you are
>
> There's no light and there's no dark
>
> Teera Deera Poora Park.

The gods paid no attention to the children singing except for Apollo, who wept
over the poor bellboy who was the last person in this world. And Apollo sang
this song:

> Teeda Reeda Booda Rad
>
> Bellboy, bellboy, I am sad.
>
> There's no people anymore
>
> Meera Keera Beera Bore.
