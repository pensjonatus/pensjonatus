"A comic book?" she smiled, "I didn't know you drew comic books. Let me see."

We were whispering, it was the campus library. The vast reading room was mostly
empty, just a few kids with smartphones. Jill put hers aside and extended her
hands, waiting for me to hand over the folder.

"I dunno, it's not ready."

"Come on, don't be a baby," she said, "I'll give it back."

"Okay," I said, "But promise not to laugh."

"Cross my heart," she said.

She looked surprised when she opened the block and saw the cover. Then she
started reading. After a few minutes she raised her head. Her cheeks were
flushed.

"Wow," she whispered in agitation, "This is great. And scary, too. I forgot
where I was for a second. Wow."

That caught me off guard. I did not expect anyone to like it, especially not
Jill. And she had no stake in being nice to me.

"Really, what do you like about it," I said and I regretted immediately. I did
not want to be an attention whore, I wanted to be cool.

She just smiled a bright smile full of sunshine and got back to my dark and
scary comic book.
