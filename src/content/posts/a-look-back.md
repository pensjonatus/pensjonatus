Life is a series of backward glances. We were on holiday, walking down a narrow
ancient street. She was a few step ahead, talking softly about classical things,
ancient Rome and Greece, and about a poet who had been dead for centuries. The
light hit her hair just right, so I lifted my camera to take a photo.

She sensed I was doing it. She stopped and looked back at me. Her eyes said
everything I was to learn in the years to come. She would marry me, but not
because she really wanted to. She would not tolerate my infidelities.  She would
have two children with me but then fight me in court to get custody. She would
never look back and think warmly of me.

If I had seen it then, would I have done anything differently?
