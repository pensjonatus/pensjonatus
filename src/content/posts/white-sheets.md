I opened my eyes and saw her lying next to me, wrapped in white sheets, awake.
She smiled brilliantly and whispered a good morning. I grabbed her and pulled
her closer for a kiss. I wanted more.

"Easy. Let's take it slow, okay?" she said.

I let her go and got up to piss. It was a long one, I got back after about a
minute. She was half sitting, still wrapped in those sheets.

"Hey, baby," I said.

"Did you like last night?" she asked. "Was it good for you?"

"Yeah. Best college reunion ever. Why?"

"I don't know," she said. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah, well," I said as I came back to bed, "I thought you would be, you know,
different. It's just I heard you used to be a stripper so I expected more of
a... A show? I guess? But this was fine, too. I guess you've had enough of that
at work and you just want to be a normal girl, huh? I can understand that."

She got up without a word and went into the bathroom, all wrapped in white
sheets.
