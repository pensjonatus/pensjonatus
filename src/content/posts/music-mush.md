The boy was carrying a guitar. A bunch of rednecks stopped by as he was walking
on the side of the road. They got out of their pickup truck to tease him which
meant they were ready to take physical action. All I could do was watch them
beat him up.

A man stopped to throw a dog out. The dog howled and ran after the car.Â A train
screamed in the distance. I know the schedule by heart.

A man and a woman stopped and the man checked the map. Then I watched them drive
away. I imagined they got a room at a bed and breakfast by a river somewhere. I
miss seeing a river, swimming in the summer, like we used to when I was a boy.

Years ago, right here at the crossroads, I signed a contract with the devil. He
made me the greatest blues man that ever waled the Earth. When I died, he turned
me into a tree. I will not know rest until somebody else signs a contract with
the devil here. But people do not believe in him anymore.
