When you leave the office building it's a cold November evening. The first thing
you hear is car tires rolling on the pavement, and you click that the sound is
incessant in cities. You walk on, listening to the cars, and now the rakka-takka
of your steps joins them. You look up, the moon is almost full, but not
completely. It seems out of place among these walls, it would be better in the
woods.

After a minute or so, the chill reaches. You embrace it, because it means winter
is coming.
