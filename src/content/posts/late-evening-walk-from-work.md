When you leave the office building it's a cold November evening. The first thing you hear is car tires rolling on the pavement, and you click that the sound is incessant in cities. You walk on, listening to the cars, and now the rakka-takka of your steps joins them. You look up, the moon is almost full, but not completely. It seems out of place among these walls, it would be better in the woods.

After a minute or so, the chill reaches. You embrace it, because it means winter is coming.
