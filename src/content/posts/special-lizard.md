There is a special lizard living on the outside wall of the lighthouse, although
it does not consider itself special. What is so special about it? Well, lizards
do not really live in cold climates, so there are no other lizards around. But
this one is okay with the cold, walking leisurely up and down the wall.

You see, this lizard really is special, because it has a special heart which is
like a bright ember in a black metal cage. Lizards are usually cold-blooded but
this one is always warm because of the ember heard. Although, it does not really
have the brain to contemplate being special.

Another thing that is special about this lizard is it does not have to eat.
Somehow, the ember heart is a source of vitality for the lizard, so it just
keeps on living. It has been alive since long before humans appeared on this
earth. It is still here now when humanity is gone. Other lizards would probably
consider that special, if they had any sense of mortality, but they do not.

This special lizard is not big, smaller than my hand. It does not do much except
climb up and down the outside wall of the lighthouse. It does not ponder, does
not think, does not enjoy the breeze and the sea. None of those are lizard
terms.

But I think it is pretty special.
