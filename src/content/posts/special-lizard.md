There is a special lizard living on the outside wall of the lighthouse, although it does not consider itself special. What is so special about it? Well, lizards do not really live in cold climates, so there are no other lizards around. But this one is okay with the cold, walking leisurely up and down the wall.

You see, this lizard really is special, because it has a special heart which is like a bright ember in a black metal cage. Lizards are usually cold-blooded but this one is always warm because of the ember heard. Although, it does not really have the brain to contemplate being special.

Another thing that is special about this lizard is it does not have to eat. Somehow, the ember heart is a source of vitality for the lizard, so it just keeps on living. It has been alive since long before humans appeared on this earth. It is still here now when humanity is gone. Other lizards would probably consider that special, if they had any sense of mortality, but they do not.

This special lizard is not big, smaller than my hand. It does not do much except climb up and down the outside wall of the lighthouse. It does not ponder, does not think, does not enjoy the breeze and the sea. None of those are lizard terms.

But I think it is pretty special.
