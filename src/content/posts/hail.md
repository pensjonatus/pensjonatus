I was almost home when I was caught in a hailstorm. I ran the final stretch and
reached the porch completely wet and sore from the tiny barrage. My uncle was
sitting there, listening to the drumming on the rooftiles.

"I was only out there for like ten seconds," I said, "And I'm all wet."

"That's Mother Nature," said my uncle, "She'll get ya'."

I sat down next to him and we both listened.

"It's nice," I said.

"Yeah, it's nice to listen to the storm when you're out of the rain."

I looked at his weathered face, it was calm. I remembered the phone in my
pocket, took it out, it was wet. "Shit," I said, but a thunder drowned my
complaint.
