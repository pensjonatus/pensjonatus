Young and in love, I followed the girl to the ends of earth. We were in the
middle of our Great Adventure Across Asia, stranded in a small town in Mongolia.
We had no money for a train ticket to move on, and the economy of the place did
not allow for strangers to make a single dime. We tried to sneak on board, but
security was tight, as if the guards were desperate to prove themselves for a
chance to get out too. Or making sure nobody leaves was their way of punishing
the State for making them suffer.

The girl was a sexual being, so she used it. She approached one of the guards, a
chubby young Asian fellow, who luckily spoke Russian. They talked for a minute
or two, and then he nodded a short disdainful agreement. They walked to the back
room where she would work for our tickets. I watched the side of her face as she
was following the wobbly man. Her jaw was strong, her lips full and enticing,
she carried her head high. She put the headphones on before she disappeared in
the narrow door.

I was left alone for a few minutes, in the stuffy, noisy waiting room, with all
the rich smells of the Mongolian country. Why did I even follow her? Out of
money, strung out and hungry, I was made her slave by the hormones that simmer
in my balls.
