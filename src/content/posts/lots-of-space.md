The house where we grew up was very calm and empty. There was very little
furniture, perhaps not enough.















In many ways, it was a philosophical kind of calm that we grew up in. Like monks
in a temple.





When I stepped outside the the house, I could see far, far into the distance.
The house was on a hill and all around were grassy hills and minimal houses with
people in neutral-colored clothing. They were craftsmen, poets, musicians, or
they worked with their laptops.













The forest was far away, but I would walk there sometimes.













































Deep the forest, there was a small clearing. It was the only dangerous place in
the area, as far as I could tell.





But the danger came very rarely.



















Only once did it threaten me.
