The greatest discovery he ever made! In a lifetime a man can only have one of
those. Only one thing that can make a difference and make other remember him.
For him, it was the underground butteflies.

The assistant cleared her throat to get his attention: "Sir, we're ready for
you, but also, you wife wants to see you after the talk."

He shrugged, "I won't have time, the interview starts right after the talk. And
then I need to meet the prime minister."

"But sir, she's come a long way."

"I know," he snapped, "She is my wife, after all. Was."

"Sir, your ex-wife will only take a few minutes. She wants to talk about
Hubert."

"For fuck's sake. Couldn't she just call me?"

Afterwards, he could not focus on giving his talk. Then he asked the assistant
to tell the interviewer he would be late.

His ex-wife was waiting by the window in the dining room. Nobody was there
except her, and she was staring out into the grey afternoon. Her back was
narrow, her shoulders small and hunched a little. She had always been small, but
now she looked emaciated. Eaten by age. Wasting.

Her dress was printed with tiny flowers but they looked like skulls in this
light. Or like the patterns on the wings of his underground butterflies. Her
neck was white, too, and her hair hadn't been washed recently.

He hesitated before getting her attention. He hanged there between the moment he
walked in and the moment the conversation would start. The moment stretched out,
longer and longer, until he could not see either side of it anymore. And in the
gray nothing, he felt like he was about to discover another great thing.

But things like that never happen twice.
