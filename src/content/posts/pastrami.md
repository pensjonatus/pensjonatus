I want a sandwich. I want the bread to be white and crunchy, and I want a lot of
pastrami. I also want greens and tomatoes.

I enter a deli. There are tiles on the the floor, red and white diamonds. Or, I
guess they are squares, if you look from a different angle. They chase one
another all the way to the wall, but people's shoes and pants are in the way,
which is to say people are standing in the line and blocking the view of the
place where the floor meets the wall. I think this would make for a good story,
except it would not.

I stand in line behind everybody and I imagine what it would be like to be a
dope fiend like the Beat Generation, and crave a sandwich after some drug
related situation. I guess they never get hungry when they do drugs, right? It's
not like marijuana.

"No, it's not," says Stacy. I realized I must've been saying some things aloud.
Am I on drugs? Or am I just weird. Or is it a mental illness. "You're fine," she
says, "Get over it."

Stacy is my anchor, she makes me a real person.

"Can you stop?"

Maybe I am not really saying anything, Stacy. Ever cross your mind? Maybe you
are hearing my thoughts. Or maybe you are just imagining these words.

"Lucas, please," she says, "People can hear you."

Except they can't. Everybody only reacts to her words, never to mine. Here, let
me prove it.

One man in the line is especially ugly. The type of guy who looks very self
confident, but he has a repulsive body and an ugly face. The type of guy who
makes women feel really uncomfortable, and complains about everyone being
offended too easily. And besides, he treats women like they're not people.

See? Nobody looked around to see if I was talking about them. What do you make
of that, Stacy?

_Fine_, Stacy thinks (instead of saying), so that people don't think she's a
crazy person, _You win. You are not saying it out loud. You are my imaginary
boyfriend. There, does that make you happy?_

That does **not** make me happy. It sounds pathetic and I feel sorry for Stacy.
I wish I was with Sandra instead. She is hotter. Thinner. She is also much more
grounded. Sandra makes me a real person.

_You literally just said that about me._

Did I? I had no idea. Reasons I am a good boyfriend:

- good looking
- artistic soul
- great in bed
- _thinks only about himself_
- going places
- interesting to be with

Wait, did you just mess with my list?

_Maybe. Or maybe you messed with it yourself._

Curiouser and curiouser. Anyway, we're next. Get me a big sandwich and fries.
Just don't eat the sandwich. You can only have a few fries.

_They don't do fries here._

They don't?

_No, it's a deli._

That's not a rule. Or is it?

Anyway. We get the sandwich, walk back to the apartment and eat it alone.
