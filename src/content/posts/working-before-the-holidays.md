The office was not as busy before the holidays, because we did not want to start
any new projects. Mark came up with the idea of office poetry, and he started
with a haiku: "Fingers tapping gently on keyboards like raindrops on the roof."
He wrote it on the whiteboard.

Everybody liked the idea and got their creative gears turning. Debbie was
second, and she wrote on the donuts using icing: "You will eat them, bringing
yourself one step closer to Heaven." Mark said it was deep and the others
agreed. I thought it was a little morbid, but I held my tongue.

Jim wrote: "I would like to kiss your cheek and say Merry Christmas, but there
are many reasons why you would not like me to." It was on post-it notes on the
window. I read it over and over.

Duncan wrote the word "excrement" repeatedly on the table using some kind of
chocolate mousse. Somebody said it was interesting but we did not look at it too
much. Duncan looked disappointed.

They all turned to me. "Well," they all said together, "What are you going to
write?" I rubbed my head and crumpled over a piece of paper. On my desk. So
pristine.
