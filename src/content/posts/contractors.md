I got my mom a new house. Well, it was pretty old, but it was new to her. She
moved in happily, and I hired a young girl called Nadia to be her nurse. My mom
was not well anymore.

But then, there were some repairs to be done, so I hired some contractors and my
mom complained about them.

"I woke up this morning, and my head was covered in that foam they use to fill
the crawlspaces. Some pieces of it were stapled to my head, actually. I got most
of it off, but I could not get rid of that muffled feeling all day."

"They started a fire, burnt the whole kitchen, and rebuilt it. Now the kettle
tastes like plastic. It's fake. I always made sure to get that real kettle, but
I guess they don't make them anymore, so the contractors had to buy a plastic
one."

"Some of them have been having sex with Nadia. The poor thing is pregnant and
has been hiding that from me, but I know. She should stop lifting heavy things,
it's bad for the baby."

"They keep moving my room and I cannot find it anymore."

I always nodded and tried to console her. Poor mom, she was not well.

I slipped the contractors some extra cash each week, just to come up with crazy
shenanigans, but after that last one, I asked them to bring my mom's room back.
