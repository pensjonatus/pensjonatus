Riding on the train, I was reading text messages from my ex-girlfriend. There
were definite signs of me becoming too clingy towards the end, but I moved
further back in time.

"I will stay out longer. Don't wait up." I remembered writing that one. I was
out all night dancing with this girl who seemed attractive in comparison but I
guess just because she was new.

"I'm coming home, should I pick up anything?" This text I guess showed how
routine it was.

"Been thinking about you all day." Oh, those were the days.

"I will love you always." She wrote that one. I guess she stopped loving me
after she found out I was sleeping around. But why did she cry? Pride?

I smiled and switched to reading the texts from the current girl and the train
raged on to an unknown terminus.
