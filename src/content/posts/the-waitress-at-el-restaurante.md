The waitress at El Restaurante saw a significant customer. He was significant,
because he looked nice, like he was part of the foreground rather than the
background. She was not attracted to him. She just thought he looked pretty and
important.

So, she took him very seriously and spoke in a serious (but friendly) way: "Hi,
welcome to El Restaurante. Would you like today's lunch special, or something
off of the menu?" And so on. She also gave him a serious look before she left,
as if she was saying "I got this, I'm a professional, so don't worry about a
thing."

When she got back behind the counter to prep the order, she had doubts. Maybe
she had been too serious? After all, even an important customer comes to El
Restaurante to kick back an relax.

As she walked to his table with his drink, she was more relaxed and whimsical.
Joyful? Happy-go-lucky? Bubbly? Words cannot describe. Should have sent a poet.

However, this was not right either. That night she would lie awake for a long
time, thinking about the customer.

The customer, on the other hand, was not special, sophisticated, or important.
He was in idiot, just like everybody else. And just like everybody else, faced
with the miracle of human interaction amidst a universe that was vast and cold
and dark, he was confused. He texted his buddy: "A waitress at El Restaurante
was checking me out today."
