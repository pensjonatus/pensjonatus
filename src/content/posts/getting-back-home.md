So tired. I was walking back home in the rain after a double shift. I did not
have my umbrella with me, so I was all wet and I had to take my glasses off
because the drops of rain on the lenses made me virtually blind. So, I watched
everything through a haze of whimsy.

Tired. I struggled to move the right leg. Then the left. Then the right. Again
and again, until I get home. My hair was ruined by the rain, but I did not care.
I did not plan on going anywhere today. Would just take a hot shower and sleep
until the morning. What time was it? It was getting dark already, probably
around five.

Ugh, so tired. I scrambled up the stone steps from the canal back to street
level. I thought briefly about food, about getting some groceries on the way,
but the even thought of bread and meat made me noxious. At street level, there
were crowds of people coming home from work, all grey and black under their grey
and black umbrellas. I stopped to wait for the green light.

On the other side of the street, a group of kids running, with their yellow
umbrellas over their heads. Why running? So tired.
