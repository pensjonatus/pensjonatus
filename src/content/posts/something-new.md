The man looked in the mirror. He was getting more handsome with age, and the
beard was a good idea. He turned sideways. Unfortunately, a tummy was beginning
to show. He lifted his shirt, the pale hairy gut did not look any better without
any cloth over it. He sucked in, but no abs showed.

He looked at the hair, it was getting long. Maybe a pony tail, or some kind of
eccentric hipster coif?

"Hun," he shouted across the living room.

"Yes, hun?" his wife shouted back, not lifting her head from the papers.

"Should I change my hair? Do something new?"

"Sure."

"How about a new style in clothes? Cowboy boots?"

"Of course, love. Whatever love wants," she said.

"A jersey? Tattoos?"

"Uh-huh," she agreed.

"How about a new wife?"

She threw a boomerang at him.

"Well played," he said when he woke up in hospital. She had missed the heart by
half an inch, because it was only a lesson.
