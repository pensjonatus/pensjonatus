We were out in a waffle house, all of us, and it was hard to talk to her because everyone would hear. Luckily, I caught her on the way to the bathroom.

"Alice, we have to talk," I said, "About us. Our relationship."

She blinked at me twice. A very bad sign. People do not blink twice for no reason. "What are you talking about?" she said with a cute serious face, "What relationship?"

"I know the way you've been trying to get my attention. In the park. All those times. I know you care about me. And I care about you."

She freed her arm from my grip. That was when I realized I was holding her and I felt silly. "David," she said, "Look. I like you. As a friend. Can't we just be friends?"

I nodded and smiled. She smiled back and then walked away. I knew it was on now. A new chapter in my life.
