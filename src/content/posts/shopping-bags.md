She was walking back from the store, carrying brown paper shopping bags. She
tried to imagine herself as seen from the houses. She pictured herself walking
left to right, red lumberjack shirt and grey sweatpants, plus a pink bandana on
her head. White sneakers flashing energetically. This was the perfect shot,
according to Hollywood rules, with the perfect light of the golden hour and the
right direction of camera movement. Yet the whole scene seemed depressing to
her.

She was feeling rested and calm, but somehow nostalgic and that nostalgia made
her sad. The kids were due back in about an hour, so she would whip up some food
for them and that would be it for the day. All the housework already done, no
extra-curriculars for the kids, no socializing needed, just a quiet night in.

"Yeah, right," she said to the empty street.

On days like this, she realized she wanted something else from life. She was not
sure what, but this walk home from the store was definitely not what the little
girl in her wanted.

She approached her block. The block where she grew up, and where her house had
always been. The house had a new coat of paint since two years ago, but it was
still the same. She remembered how they used to hide in the bushes across the
street to play a prank on their dad.

The shopping bags were slipping down too low, so she hoisted them up and went
upÂ the porch steps.
