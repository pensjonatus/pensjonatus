She wore blue jeans and a denim jacket. She lifted the shades to look me in the
eye.

"Excuse me, is this the train to Yorkville."

"Yes," I said.

I wished she would stay a little longer and talk, but she sat down a few rows
away and only then did I notice she had a child with her. She spoke to it softly
(I did not know, a boy or a girl) explaining the world. I imagined she was kind
and I wished my future children had a mother like that.

When the conductor came to inspect the tickets, she did not have one for the
child. He was polite and explained the child was old enough so she had to pay. I
wanted to hear the story she was telling him explaining why she did not have the
money and why it was important for her to get to Yorkville.

No, I did not want to know the story. It probably involved a man she was
travelling to see and I was jealous. Irrational!
