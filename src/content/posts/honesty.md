I cannot say I was not hoping for the opportunity, but also I was definitely not
looking for it. Nevertheless, there she was in my hotel room, slightly drunk,
with a head full of stupid ideas. We were in San Francisco on business, looking
for a way into the West Coast robotics industry.

“Tomorrow after lunch, we should talk to Henderson,” she said, “This will give
us an opportunity to reach his IsoDyne connection.”

“He’s going to be sleepy and vulnerable,” I said, half-jokingly and she laughed.
A good sign.

“I’m a little sleepy too,” she said, rubbing her eyes, “I should go.” She
paused, staring at me now. Once again, I was amazed at how bright her eyes were.
“You know?” she continued, “People don’t give you enough credit. You do great
work for the company.”

There was a moment of silence as we were looking at each other, trying to guess
what the other person was thinking. This was not the best line I have ever seen
her use, but I thought I understood her intentions. So I touched her cheek. She
reacted well, as she had in the past. This time, our faces glided closer
together. A kiss was coming.

But something made me feel bad, so I said: “I don’t want to be with you, or
share the rest of my life with you. I just want to sleep with you.”

I knew she would react well to that, too. But I also was hoping she would know
if I was being honest or not.
