Last man on Earth, alone in a room. What would he do?

Wake up regularly every morning, work out, go on a food run or use some of the
organic food he grew. Then do some work around the house, make sure things are
keeping together. He would want to stay in the same place in case... Just in
case.

The rest of the time would be entertainment. Would he read books, listen to
music, watch movies, play video games, engage in holodiscs or experience
sensocubes? What if he was the creative type? He would write, or code, or paint,
or sculpt, or sew, or knit, or dance, or play music, or record videos, or make
animated movies,Â or something. He would find a way to keep busy.

He would probably talk to himself, try to hear his own voice like it was the
voice of another. He would try to surprise himself, get drunk and then marvel at
the things he had done the night before. He would go back to the places he knew
and relive memories. He would touch the leaves at the botanical garden and smell
the river (would it smell different?) and walk the ravines.

Last man on Earth, alone in a room. There was a knock on the door. His wife just
got back from her business trip.
