A girl sometimes seems interesting when she is, in fact, boring. We see things
that are normally connected with things of interest and are fooled. Same goes
for a man, a place, an event, a book, a movie, a quote, a bowl, a piece of
clothing, a chair, a button, a universe.

I have met many boring girls who seemed interesting at first glance. I have
dated quite a few as well. At one point, I figured perhaps a girl that seems
completely boring would turn out to be interesting. She did not. Then I had a
brief gay episode, but that ended as soon as physical closeness began. There is
just something about a penis that does not appeal to me. Is it the smell?

Irregardless, I was really surprised to learn Sarah was actually an interesting
person. Mind you, I did not learn it through our interactions, and I did not
know it when we started going out either. It was my hero's journey that made me
realize. But I should have known from the start.

Sarah had all the signs of a girl who is only pretending to be interesting:
short bleached hair, tattoos, being a poetess, having traveled the longer
dimension of South America, a collection of vinyl, and more. And yet, there was
another layer. A true depth of character.

Sarah went to a regular American high school, not an outlandish boarding school
like me, and had a normal experience of being alienated, crushed, melted, and
remolded to fit the norms of the society. She seemed perfectly aligned with what
they were trying to do to her. She got with the program. She hitched her wagon
onto the right star. She followed the drummer. She had good grades, dressed
modestly, cooked with her mom, and went to church every Sunday. The teachers
loved her and other parents always told their kids "Can't you be more like that
Sarah M\_\_\_\_?"

She was such a beloved teacher's pet that Mr. Cole, the science teacher, made
her the lab assistant. She had the keys and unlimited access to his office where
all the equipment was and it was her job to bring it to class when needed and
then put it away.

One afternoon, she was putting microscopes back on the shelves. It was a late
afternoon in springtime. The sun shone warmly through the open blinds making the
office look like a noir detective's office, except that Mr. Cole was sitting at
his desk over his laptop. They worked peacefully side by side, like a pigeon and
a sparrow.

"Sarah," he said, "Have you chosen a college yet?"

She turned around to face him. He was holding his hands over the keyboard, like
he stopped working unexpectedly. "I don't know, Mr. Cole. I think either Brown
or Stanford. They have such good science programs."

He nodded, satisfied. "You know, I am a Brown man myself."

"Go Bears," she said, throwing her fist into the air. He laughed. The little
grey mouse looked nothing like a cheerleader. She reminded him of his daughter.

"I am willing to write you a letter of recommendation," he said.

"Thank you, Mr. Cole. I was going to ask, but I," she looked away, pretending to
be shy. The truth was, she was not sure if she would choose Brown. She was not
even sure if she was college material. Plus, she did the calculations and it
would take her 17 years to re-pay the loans. She did not really have the courage
to tell her parents. To disturb the evening in the living room with bad news
like this. To be a bad example to her sisters.

"Well don't worry about it. I'll have it to you by Friday, what do you say?"

"I don't want to be a bother."

"You're not. No problem at all."

"Please, Mr. Cole, don't inconvenience yourself."

Mr. Cole's phone began vibrating on his desk. "Nonsense, Sarah," he said, "I'll
have it for you first thing Friday, and that is the end of the discussion. Now
will you excuse me, I have to take this." He left the office in a hurry,
speaking to the phone in an annoyed voice.

Sarah finished putting the microscopes away and then twirled around the office a
little bit like Tinkerbell. She ended up at Mr. Cole's desk, looking at the
screen of his laptop. It was the final test in one document, and the answer key
in the other. She sat down and began reading.

She did not feel guilty. She thought a good scientist needed to be curious and
that was more important than following the rules of some silly game. She
believed school and tests were part of a game everybody played, for example when
you had to pretend you had to study to get the answers right, or you had to show
how you calculated something, even though you could do it in your head without a
problem. Grades were a form of gamification, a clever incentive to get students
hooked on work. Later, those grades would be replaced by yearly reviews that
made one eligible for a raise or a promotion, and the game continued.

Sarah had just finished reading _The Stranger_ by Camus, a rite of passage for
angsty 17-year-olds. It was about a jaded young man who shot another man to see
what it felt like to pull the trigger. The part the followed was his trial and
(spoilers removed), and it was all to show a detached, dismissive anti-hero who
refused to follow the rules of society. How silly! But it did inspire her to ask
one question. "What would it feel like to pull the trigger?"

She did not hesitate any further, she just emailed the test and the results to
herself.

"You did what?" asked her best friend Ella in a truly Hollywood transition.

"I have them all printed here," said Sarah, pointing to a neat stack of papers
on her desk. It was later that night in her room, she had called Ella to come
and learn the secret.

"But that's cheating," said Ella.

Sarah put on a mischievous face. She pictured the guy from _A Clockwork Orange_,
with the smirk and the one-eye makeup. It felt interesting to be in this role,
but there was more to her plan than just cheating on a test.

"Are you going to sell them or what?"

"No point in selling, I don't need the money. I will give them away."

"But why?"

"Chaos," Sarah laughed. She pictured the Joker from Batman. A life of a crime
lord would be interesting, but she was not really interested in being evil.
Letting chaos reign, now that was something that seemed appealing to Sarah.
"Chaos makes us deal with unexpected new situations. It doesn't allow us to
become complacent and grow old and fat. A wave of chaos can reforge an entire
community. Make people reconsider their goals. Make the society progress."

Ella nodded her head, perhaps the beginnings of tears appeared in her eyes.
"This is so typical of you, Sarah. I wish people knew what you were really
like."

Sarah got closer, put her hands on Ella's shoulders and looked her deep in the
eye. She forgot all the images of heroes in pop culture, she focused on Ella. In
this focus, she began to forge her true self.

"Listen, Ella, this is very important to me. Think of it as an experiment. I
want to see it through. That is why I am telling you. You have always been my
friend and I need you for this to work. I need you not to say anything to
anybody. Can you promise me that?"

Ella nodded, the tears shining in her eyes.

"Say it, Ella. Say 'I promise.'"

"I promise I won't tell anyone," she said. That young woman on the verge of
adulthood was trembling with fear and almost breaking under the weight of the
secret. How could she live in the real world, where so much is based on lies and
communal self-deception, where she could not even cheat at the the game of
school? Sarah felt honestly and deeply sorry for her friend, but at the same
time felt these events needed to transpire. She hugged Ella warmly, stroking her
head gently.

"Shhhhhh, it will all be over soon. The test is the day after tomorrow. I will
distribute the answers tomorrow. Nobody will know. I just need you to keep
quiet. In the meantime, enjoy the pain and the fear. Pain and fear help us grow.
Shhhhhhhh. My little Ella, it will be all better soon," and so on. Sarah
comforted and Ella sobbed.

If this was a movie, this would be the time for a montage. Joyful music playing
while Sarah's classmates pass on folded pieces of papers. Jock would pass it to
a nerd, he would touch his glasses and then look in disbelief. Somebody would
threaten him with a prematurely-developed fist to justify why the teachers did
not find out about this before the test. The spirit of the class, the social
contract, the just rebellion against the oppressor. A scruffy-looking kid would
run up to a bunch of beautiful kids having lunch outdoors and they would all
lean in to see a piece of paper he put on the table. There would be shots of
photocopiers, a guy at Target nodding knowingly at customers who are barely a
year younger than him. Somebody would be copying the answers to a tiny piece of
paper that could easily be concealed. Fade to black on that scene, as the music
comes to a conclusion.

Two days later, the results of the test were announced. It was a rainy
springtime Friday morning and the school was in chaos. People screamed at each
other, both teachers and students, and the entire microcosm reeled in a cyclone
around a tiny frame or a girl, with no-color brown hair, wearing a loose grey
cardigan, smiling like the guy from _A Clockwork Orange_. The eye of the storm
is always quiet.

She was sitting in front of the principal.

"Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, what should I do about you? What can I do?" He paused for
a moment, hoping she would break, show some remorse, or talk back. Either way
would make it easier for him. But she just sat there, not even defiant. Just
focused like somebody about to disarm an atomic bomb with ten seconds to go.
"You just made ninety percent of your class fail the science test. They will all
have to retake it. Then I'm going to have to figure out what to do about the
fact they all cheated. And what do I tell the parents. I am so disappointed in
you. Why, Sarah? Why did you give them the wrong answers?"

"Are you actually asking me?"

"Yes, please," she shouted, raising his arms in the air, but then he calmed
down. "Sorry. Please, tell me what this is all about?"

"Well, what would have happened if they just passed the final test?"

He rolled his eyes.

"Humor me, principal Jackson."

"Okay, you're saying they wouldn't have learned the important lesson. Is that
what you were trying to do? Teach them something school would never teach them?
And what is that? Not to trust the honor student when she encourages them to
cheat? Not to cheat? That there are no shortcuts in life?" he stopped talking.
He was breathing heavily. His heart was not what it used to be, struggling to
pump the blood around his fat, out-of-shape, stressed body. He wiped the sweat
off his brow.

The girl in front of him seemed not to blink. In some way, she looked elated.
Like somebody who achieved the unachievable, or like a climber on the summit.
The return back down would be a hell in itself, but the moment of being higher
than anything else around, that was a reward worth dying for.

"I have to take disciplinary action against you. This will be in your permanent
record. This has to follow you through the rest of your education. I am so
sorry, Sarah, but this will greatly diminish your chances of getting into an Ivy
League university. Mr. Cole will be so disappointed. I know he was writing a
letter of recommendation for you. He will be heartbroken." The principal bowed
his head and shook it in disbelief. Then he was quiet for a few moments.

He wanted to tell her he admired what she did. She actually passed the test for
adulthood by going outside of her comfort zone, way, way out of it, and not
thoughtlessly, for a prank or anything else, but mindfully, with a purpose.
Never mind if it was misguided or not. She took action instead of grinding on.
He wanted to commend it, and he would many times after that, when he was just
Wade entertaining his friends at a barbecue, or mingling at a party. As
principal Jackson, he could not condone this kind of behavior. He had to fulfill
the obligations of his role.

"I would expel you," he said, "But it would not make any sense, one week before
graduation. I still have to think about whether I want to make you repeat the
year. Now go home, I don't think you want to be seen around today."

"I can go to class," she said.

"Go home, Sarah. You've done enough."

She left the office, went down the empty hallway towards the exit. The last
remark was probably supposed to be a blow. Like when you break a glass and your
mom shows up, and you try to pick up the pieces, but she says "Go to your room.
You've done enough." But she did not feel remorse.

And she did not feel remorse when she saw Mr. Cole in the hallway. He looked so
disappointed, but she just met his gaze until he looked away. She did not mean
to be cruel. She probably did not feel better than anyone. She probably felt
everybody benefited from what she did.

Later in the day, she would see a similar look on her mother's and her father's
faces. They did not show any sign of understanding what a sacrifice this was for
her.

"You do not understand the world, Sarah," said her father at the kitchen table,
"You do not know how hard it was for me or your mother. Without higher
education, all you can hope for is a house like this, a dead-end job like mine,
and a life by the grindstone."

Her mother was standing by the kitchen sink "All your father and I wanted was
for you girls to be happy. Wanted you to have a better life."

"Mom, that may not be the life I want. I do not know yet. But going to college
would mean I have to keep this life up for almost twenty years to pay off the
loans. That is longer than I have been alive so far. Would I be able to do
anything else after that? I know I won't be able to get a high-paying job now. I
know I will have to struggle. But I will make my own way in the world. I will
discover what my purpose is. Don't you want me to?"

Her father wanted to scream at her, but he was too tired for that. He was always
tired. He turned around to look at his wife. She came closer and put her hand on
his shoulder. He looked towards the living room, his two younger daughters were
sitting on the couch, looking at the kitchen scene. Their eyes were just like
his wife's eyes, and just like Sarah's. They were so full of hope, looking at
him for guidance and protection. He turned back to Sarah and reached out his
hand.

She put her hand in his. Tears appeared in her eyes.

"So what do we do now?" he asked.

At least, that is how I imagine it happened. I was not there.
