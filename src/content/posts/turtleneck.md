Paul got himself a new turtleneck. It was white, so he got a white jacket to go
with it. He went out to meet some girls.

"Hey there, gorgeous," he said to the billionth chick that evening, "Is it just
you, or is this room really hot?"

"Ha, that's a good one, I've never heard that one before, " she said in
a friendly tone. Paul decided to pursue the matter.

"Can I buy you a drink?"

"Sure!"

They drank a couple and had some laughs. Paul made sure he sounded macho and
alpha male all the time. He also made sure he was funny but a touch arrogant. It
was a success, because she often fixed her hair and exposed her neck. She also
manipulated around her lips a lot.

Finally, Paul said:

"Hey, let's get out of here," and she agreed.

When they were done sexing, he put his arm around her and asked:

"Why did you come back with me?"

"I don't know," she replied, "There's something special about you."

"Is it the turtleneck?" he asked.
