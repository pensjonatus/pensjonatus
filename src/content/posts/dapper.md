Jake got a new old-looking suit and a trilby hat. He stood in front of the
mirror for a good few minutes, admiring the result. Jenny was on the couch, on
her phone.

"What do you think?" he asked.

"I think you look like someone, who's trying too hard," she said.

Jake shook his head. "No, you see? This makes everything better. You know how
I'm scrawny-looking"

"Lanky," she said.

"Sure. But too thin, anyway. No matter how much time I spend at the gym, I'm
skinny. T-shirts don't look good on me. But when I put on this suit... It's a
good look, don't you think?"

"So where are you going?"

"I'm meeting my brother at the tracks."

"Horses? Racing? Bets? Really?" she said. And then she pretended to be an
old-timey gangster "If you try anything, you'll be sleeping with the fishes,
kiddo. So no monkey business."

"So what are you saying?"

"The crowd at the tracks are not gonna be dapper like you. Polo shirts and
mustard stains. Are you gonna sit on one of those benches in these pants?
Fuh-gedda-bouddit."

"I'll stick out," he said, losing his spirits.

"And you only got this one suit. What are you gonna wear tomorrow?"

He sighed. "Yeah. I'll change into something else."

"Polo shirts and mustard stains," she yelled after him.
