The party felt pretty wild to the four guys who were drinking heavily. They
seemed like kind of a curiosity to the rest.

"Hey, Raul you ever played shotgun head?"

"No, what is that?"

"Here, let me show you."

Jason stuck a pocket-knife into the beer can and then shook it. When he pulled
the knife out, beer gushed out. He put his mouth to it to catch as much as he
could.

"Here, now you try."

Raul got two can like this into him.

"Now drink this whiskey," said Jason, "In the ghetto, we call it Evil Jesus."

Raul was starting to lose touch with reality. The room was spinning. He got into
a fight with one of the guys, but it broke up when some new girls arrived and
said they wanted to catch up.

Raul could barely see Sondra, the girl from his psychology class when he was
saying, "Hey Sondra. I like you, I wanna fuck you."

"Well, well," she said, "I didn't know you were this brave. I always thought you
were kind of a nerd."

"Take my room, kids," said Jason.

Raul thought she was kidding when she pulled him into the bed and sat on top of
him.

"I'm yours tonight, nerd-boy," she said.

Sondra started pulling at his belt buckle. The same belt his mom gave him as a
going-away-to-college present.
