I was taking the morning train to work. It was pretty empty at this hour, so I could sit back with my book and relax.

A homeless guy climbed aboard on one of the stations. He had all his possessions with him in a large duffel bag, a sizable parcel of winter clothes and God knows what else. I certainly do not, as I never had to rely on my own self for storage and transportation of all my possessions. He also smelled pretty bad, as is the misfortune of the homeless. He sat a little ways away from me.

Right before aÂ stop, he fumbled in his bag a little and then dropped a number of small objects. Taka, taka, taka, tak, they fell to the floor. I glanced discreetly to see what they were. Chocolates. Small, individually wrapped, expensive chocolates. Why would a homeless person not buy expensive chocolates, I thought. Perhaps he preferred them over alcohol. It made me happy to know he had them.

He scrambled to pick them up and then rushed to the door to get off. I stayed on, saw him walk down the platform chewing and smiling, and I smiled too. Then I looked to where he had been sitting and found out he had missed one chocolate. It was on the floor, underneath a seat. I smiled and hoped somebody would find it and have a nice day.
