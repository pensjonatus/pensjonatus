Oh, Mr. Sandoval, you are always so busy, running from meeting to meeting. Your
work is very important and people rely on you, so you have to be there. Even
sitting by the pool, you look at your shiny gold watch because time is always
ticking away and you always want to know where you are in it.

Oh, Mr. Sandoval, can you sometimes go back to a calmer time? When you were
younger and everything around you was new. Everything had potential to be the
start of an adventure. Everyone you met could turn out to be a lifelong friend.
Or a fiery lover.

Oh, Mr. Sandoval, you are not interesting, not in the sense we're used to from
show business. You import and export things, but not illegal, and you work
within the framework of a large corporation. Global trade yes, travel yes, but
exploration? No.

Oh, Mr. Sandoval, you had the seed of a sailor, a fencer, a thinker, a poet, a
guardian of an ancient library. But now you see those were all commercial
ventures and very paper-bound number-framed.

Oh, Mr. Sandoval, who will remember you? Will you remember yourself?
