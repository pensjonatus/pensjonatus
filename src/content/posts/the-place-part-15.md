There was no light anywhere, completely black. When I held out my hands in front
of me, I could not see them, so, after a little bit, I started suspecting they
were not even there. Meanwhile, the room stretched out and out. Too big to be
called a room anymore. I was in a black world. Maybe a black universe.

I had been walking for a long time. I couldn't be sure how long, you cannot
measure time in complete darkness. If I could hear the beats of my heart, I
could count those.

I grabbed my wrist and got the pulse. A sigh of relief escaped me, as I assured
myself I was still real and had arms. I started counting the beats. 1... 2...
3... 4...

Then re-focused on the sound of footsteps. It had become slower and deliberate,
like it was leading me. So I followed. The rhythm was different than my
heartbeat. Made sure I do not lose track of it. 47... 48... 49...

It was entirely possible I was in a long dark hallway. Not an enormous room at
all. If I stepped to the side, I would hit the wall. Surely! Right? 130...
131... 132...

The next part, I cannot be sure it really happened. The mind creates illusions
when under stress and when deprived of stimuli. So it could all be just a dream.
Nevertheless, let me tell you about it.
