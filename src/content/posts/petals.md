Mary was sitting on the wall. The sun was bright, the day was warm, she was
remembering Mark and picking petals off a daisy.

"He loves me, he loves me not..." she kept repeating.

There had been another man. She wanted to get closer to him, but he was her
sister's boyfriend. Mary gave out a sigh and looked to the horizon far, far
away. This little trip to the country was nice, and she was happy to see aunt
Melanie, but she could not rest because her mind was racing all the time. She
would have to return to the city soon and face Mark again. She picked up another
daisy.

"He loves me, he loves me not, it's complicated, he loves me..."
