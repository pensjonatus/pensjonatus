"Well, here we go," said Marshal as the plane was taking off.

"Here we go," said Mary, smiling the sweetest of sweet smiled.

They were holding hands, flying across the Atlantic to their romantic holiday in
Venice. Need I say they were in love?

Marshal leaned back and thought of the cost. It was not that great, and he was
always generous. Mary was falling asleep, that little flower, her eyes were
accentuated with black, her lips full, her breast ripe and soft. She would soon
pay her own way, in laced lingerie in front of a fireplace. Not a high price. A
fair one.
