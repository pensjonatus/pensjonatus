We always went out to eat on Fridays, and the meals were great. One of her
favorite restaurants was Rabo's Baked Meat, run by a bearded Armenian guy. The
guy's father was called Rabo and he set up the place when he came over from the
old country. But I digress.

When at Rabo's, we ordered our favorites: Baked Squirrel for me and Crab Delight
for her. Mind you, there was no real squirrel in the dish, it was only called
Squirrel. It was beef, I think, but the waiter would never tell us. Part of the
charm, I guess.

Now, for the Crab Delight, I am not sure. It had a distinct sea-foody or
fish-foody taste, and it was small chunks of white meat. But it wasn't like
those imitation crab meat sticks, it had more texture.

Then I got into reading Lovecraft, and I noticed certain hints at Lovecraftian
lore in the restaurant, like the wonky pentagram with the eye in the center, the
squid mounted on the wall, or the ceiling painted in constellations. Were they
actual constellations we can see in the sky? I don't know anything about stars,
so no. They might have just been stars painted on the ceiling by a guy ordered
to paint stars, no plan other than bright spots on a dark background. Or they
might have been the stars you would see from an alien world, far, far away.
Wouldn't that be cool?

Wouldn't it be cool if the meat...
