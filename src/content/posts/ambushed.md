They were just friends hanging out after work, they both had somebody. He was
being a rascal, and she was being sassy. At some point she made a joke about him
being gay.

"Yeah?" he said, "You wish that were true. You just feel bad none of this," he
gestured jokingly at his crotch, "can ever be yours."

"You think so?"

"I know so."

"Oh, yeah," she said, "We'll just have to see."

"Oh, you got a plan?"

"Maybe I do. But do you have to spoil it?"

He paused for a second. This was getting serious. "Yes," he replied
half-serious, "'Because if we play this game, we play by my rules," and then he
blushed.
