"I'm going to be honest with you, Mr. Baker," said the therapist.

"Terry," I said, "I want us to start this on a friendly note. And be friends. I
want to be friends with you."

"Alright, Terry. I'm going to be honest with you, this method of therapy is
controversial, but I've had some success already and I am willing to continue.
Even though there is the occasional... mishap."

"Mishap?"

"Nothing for you to worry about right now. Just focus on the immediate goal."

"Fine," I said, "So what do we do?"

"Now remember, people come to therapy because they have a problem. You came here
because you have a problem. And the type of problems people bringÂ to therapy are
usually secrets. Imagine there is something ugly and painful, perhaps abominable
and tormentous, in the corner of your room. You go about your day not looking at
it, not talking about it, not acknowledging it. You work, you eat, you sleep,
while this thing grows in the corner of the room, always outside your field of
vision, but always there. And it lets you know it's there from time to time. Are
you picturing it?"

I nodded slowly and then a growl came from the corner of the room, like the
sound of two universes rubbing against each other as they pass in the void. I
turned my head towards it. Slowly.
