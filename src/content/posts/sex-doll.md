"Striker, snap out of it, man," Toad's voice sounded distant and distorted, like
a sub-band transmission gone awry.

"I'm out already," said Striker, getting up from the ground. Reality around him
was slowly moving back into focus. It was a real bad trip down the rabbit hole.
A virtual reality run gone bad.

"The buyer's out. We fucked up," said Toad.

"We fucked up?" Striker was angry. "WE?"

"Okay, so I fucked up. But it was only five grand. We can make it up with a week
of web grafting. Tops."

"Whatever," Striker started walking away, checking the account balance on his
holospecs.

"Hey, Striker," Toad followed him, "Wanna get a cyber drink?"

"Fuck off, Toad. I have to be places."

"Okay, okay, cool it, Strike. You need to cool it, man. I am not your enemy."

"You just set me 5 thousand credits back."

"Only two and a half of that was yours, Strike."

"Whatever, man," Striker called his hover transport.

"Whatever, man, whatever," Toad echoed his partner's words. "You just dying to
be with that whore again."

"She's not a whore, Toad," Striker hissed without even looking at the man.

"She's a sex doll. And she costs you money. Money what could go to your sister."

"She's not just a sex doll, Toad. You wouldn't understand."

The hover transport touched the ground. Striker thought for a second she was
there, looking at him from the backseat window. But she was not. Why would she
be? She had customers to service at the Pleasuredome. Why would she lose income
over such a loser. Striker felt his evening depression roll in.
