I am an ass man, definitely. I have dated a lot of girls and only one of them
had big breasts, but all of them had large round asses.

I like to consider myself a feminist. I am an opponent of the pay gap, I think
women should be allowed to breastfeed in public places and abort pregnancies and
other such affairs at their own discretion. But I cannot deny myself the
pleasure of looking at a nice rounded behind. An ass.

I am also possessive of the asses I own, for as long as I own them. For example,
one of my girlfriends posed in a thong for the cover of a famous musician's
album. We fought for hours, screaming and yelling and then we broke up. I sent
her drunk texts for months after that. I guess I did not have the chance to fall
out of love the natural way.

Another of my girlfriends lost a lot of weight and her ass disappeared. I was
not impressed by her abs and her thigh gap, no siree. All I could think about
was that I could now cover both her buttocks with one hand and how unjust that
was to me, a lover of asses.

I consider myself to be a good guy, and good guys finish last.
