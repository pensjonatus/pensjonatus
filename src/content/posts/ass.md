I am an ass man, definitely. I have dated a lot of girls and only one of them had big breasts, but all of them had large round asses.

I like to considerÂ myself a feminist. I am an opponent of the pay gap, I think women should be allowed to breastfeed in public places and abort pregnancies and other such affairs at their own discretion. But I cannot deny myself the pleasure of looking at a nice rounded behind. An ass.

I am also possessive of the asses I own, for as long as I own them. For example, one of my girlfriends posed in a thong for the cover of a famous musician's album. We fought for hours, screaming and yelling and then we broke up. I sent her drunk texts for months after that. I guess I did not have the chance to fall out of love the natural way.

Another of my girlfriends lost a lot of weight and her ass disappeared. I was not impressed by her abs and her thigh gap, no siree. All I could think about was that I could now cover both her buttocks with one hand and how unjust that was to me, a lover of asses.

I consider myself to be a good guy, and good guys finish last.
