I was sitting at the kitchen table with my laptop powered down, a cup of coffee
in front of me. The sky outside was getting gray-blue, the sun would set soon. I
focused on being in the moment, something I read in a book about Steve Jobs or
someone like that. I was winding down after a day of hard work.

Suddenly, the front door slammed open, and then shut. I turned around just in
time to see my son rush by. I got up and leaned out into the hallway to watch
him climb upstairs. His head was lowered, his bag hung carelessly, banging each
step like he did not care about the contents. His mind was on something more
important.

"Brad," I said, "Are you okay, son?"

"Fine," he said.

"Dinner in an hour, okay?"

"Whatever," he said and disappeared.

I got back to my coffee and tried to imagine what made him this way. It made me
smile. Am I a bad parent because of that?
