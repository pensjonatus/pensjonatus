"It's very gross. I mean just thinking about it makes me wanna puke. What kind of a guy would do something like that?"

"I guess it's kind of okay. I mean, I don't mind. As long as I never meet them. When I think that some of the guys I know do that. We're somewhere with a group of friends or something and the guy is looking at me thinking about what he did last night. I don't know."

"I'm totally fine with it and I understand. I do it too. When I masturbate, or when I am making love to my boyfriend I sometime imagine some guy I know. Not so much looking at their photos, but I understand how someone would do that."

"Seriously, that's sad. A guy is sitting home alone with his laptop, going through my photo gallery, doing it. I mean, what kind of a life does he have that he has to do that?"

"I wonder if you can do that to somebody's pictures and not think about actually doing it with them. I mean, when you know nothing can ever happen between the two of you. Do you even want anything to happen, or are you fine with just doing it by yourself?"

"I think it's kind of sexy. I'm flattered."

"If I found out my husband does that, I would flip. Oh my God, I just realized he probably does that. Does he? Oh my God, I'm sure he does."

"I'm not a model or anything. I wonder how models feel about that. Do they stayÂ in shape, make sure their hair looks good, and go to photo shoots as a job, knowing that guys do it while looking at their pictures?"
