Our Sun is falling towards a supermassive unseen object known as the Great
Attractor. The speed of this event is 600 kilometers per second relative to the
Universe's background radiation. If the Earth revolved around the Sun at that
speed, each year would only be 18 days long.

For Ellie, the great conflict began when she discovered her husband's mistress's
blog. The slutty slutty girl described all the intimate details of the forbidden
relationship, and Ellie soon began to compete. Letting him come in her mouth and
anal were just the tip of the ice berg. The amount of depravity Ellie took upon
herself was legendary.

The apogee was reached when Ellie read that her husband loved the slut's potato
salad.

"He always said he hated potato salad," said Ellie, "Perhaps he only hated _my_
potato salad."

So she took to the kitchen for seven days to perfect her recipe. When she
finally emerged, the victorious bowl made her husband squeal in the excess of
onions, garlic, meat and other wonderful ingredients. He was ready to reunite
with his spouse for a little bit of forever.

Meanwhile, the Sun continued its steady fall towards the unknown, pulling
our Earth along with him.
