"And here we are again, in my office, talking about the same thing," the
substance abuse counselor said. And we were in his office, tiny little office
cluttered with knick-nacks, empty takeaway coffee cups, papers, newspapers,
candy wrappers, pamphlets, at least three teddy bears, books, diplomas, framed
photos, pictures, sculptures, statuettes, and trophies.

"Dave," I pled, "Please, don't. I know what I did." I think I started crying at
that point, not sure if it was sincere. "I have a disease. And there is no
cure."

"The rules are here to help you to live with that disease," he said, "But you
have to obey them. Don't put yourself in those situations, avoid those people,
and call your sponsor. Your guys are there to support each other. Now that the
court sent you here, I have no other choice. Mandatory rehab, six months."

"But I have a career. I'm in a good place now. I'm gonna lose it all." I put my
fingers through my thinning hair. "Please, you have to realize, this is all I
have."

"No, *you*Â have to realize," he thumped the desk rhythmically as he spoke, "This
stuff will kill you. That's why we have laws. To prevent the loss of lives, to
protect the state from spending on treatment. You're lucky they're not putting
you in jail."

"I know it's bad, but it feels so good. You know it does."

He leaned back, dissatisfied, he spent a good while looking out the window. I
kept thinking about another fix.

"I need help," I said.

"Cholesterol," he said, "It's what it all boils down to."

I imagined a nice big chunk of gorgonzola.

"Cholesterol will clog your veins and turn your body into a stinking pile of
dead meat. Is that what you want?"

"No," I began crying again. Images of plates of pasta with a thick layer of
melted cheese rushed through my head. How many have I had in my junkie life? Too
many to count.

"Then get clean, and no more cheese."

"I know," I wailed.

"Good," he nodded in approval. "Good. One day at a time."
