Jake was twelve and his life was great. But that day he wanted to go for a walk
with Mandy and play by the river, and he could not.

Her mother had told him Mandy was having her _menstrual cramps_. He felt sorry
for her so he came back with an m&m cookie and climbed the window to give it to
her. Mandy cried and then yelled at him.

He was at the river alone, throwing rocks. He knew about the monthly cycle from
his sisters, but he did not really know how it worked with the hormones and all
that. He could not help but imagine girls were built completely different than
boys. They had a blood factory in their stomach and their brains were wired to
their hearts. He looked up at the sky and wondered if girls had come to Earth in
a spaceship millions of years ago.

Meanwhile, millions of light years away, on the home planet of men, Captain Jet
Buckley was preparing to travel to the planet of fembots.

It was a rescue mission.
