"Does everything in San Francisco happen on rooftops?" I asked.

She looked at me and smiled, then she took a sip of beer. I looked above her
head, the sun was just about to rise over the city. The party was melting away,
we were among the last few people standing.

"So," she asked, "You'll be going back to school soon?"

"Yeah. I gotta get my bachelor's this year."

"Cool," she nodded and sighed.

"Anyway, I gotta get going," I said.

"Are you tired?"

"Yeah, kind of. I need to drive to Oakland tomorrow."

"You should take the train. You'll be tired."

"I have to run a few errands around town. I'll figure it out." Should I ask her
to join me?

"Okay, I'll just be hanging out with my mom," she said. Maybe I should ask her
to join me? But what is the point. I will be out of here in a few days and a
long-distance thing will never work.

"I'll give you a call," I said. I gave her a kiss on the cheek, she smelled like
bubblegum and weed. She touched my arm as I was pulling away, our eyes met. I
think I sighed.

On my way to the stairs, I dumped my beer cup in the trash. Bill was sitting
nearby, surrounded by a few stoners. He looked at me and gave me a nod. His eyes
looked sad, there was a sense of longing in them.  This single look brought me
back to the stuffy apartment we used to share and the doubts about my sexuality
I used to have. A cliche in this beautiful city.

I gave him a nod too. He sighed.
