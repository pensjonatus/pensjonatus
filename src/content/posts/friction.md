Jake rang the doorbell. Normally, he would just walk in because this used to be
his girlfriend's house. Well, it was still the same woman's house, but she was
no longer his girlfriend. He broke up with her five days before. She called
several times, asking for him to come over.

Now he just rang the bell. She opened quickly and flashed her pale face for a
second from behind the screen door. She asked him to come in while turning away,
her voice low and shaky, jaded as usual.

Jake stepped inside. It was dark with the curtains drawn. Jesus fucking Christ,
she lit some candles. The music in the background was disgusting. They used to
make love to this music.

She whispered an awkward hello, only then did she turn to face him. She was dead
white with the heavy makeup, her lips as red as blood. She had been crying. Was
she trying to be pretty? Does she not know beauty comes from within?

Jake had broken up with her before, but she begged until he took her back. The
following six months were the worst in his life.

"Is it gonna end now?" she asked, "After five years. It's just gonna end like
this?"

"Yeah, you know what you did," he muttered, looking away. Her display of
weakness disgusted him.

"What did I do that is so terrible? What? I am a woman, aren't I?"

"A woman? A woman is kind and loving. You only think about yourself. Why should
the both of us love only you?"

She started crying. Screaming. He turned and walked away.

The air was crisp and fresh, the sun was shining, it was almost springtime. The
world was becoming more and more beautiful.
