She had had an okay day at work. Got a little tired but not too bad, had some
conflict but not too much, and had some success, but not staggering. Now she was
just killing some time and catching up with her favorite cartoon. She was
sitting in front of her laptop with headphones on, chuckling.

Then her boyfriend came back. He was having a bad day. He looked at her with
disdain which then turned into sadness. She took her headphones off to hear what
he had to say.

"Hi honey," he said and gave her a kiss on the cheek. "Why do they keep me on? I
am worthless. I just hope they don't realize. Or better yet, I hope they do
realize, so I can be fired and live in the dumpster, where I belong."

She just said "Aaawww, honey."

Then she put her headphones back on, put a blanket over her head and got back to
the cartoon. She could not hear the desperate sound of the shower.
