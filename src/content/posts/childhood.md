The sun was setting over the Ocean and three people were sitting on the terrace,
all dressed in white and reminiscing.

"Before I came to Hollywood, I was just a cab driver in Philly. It was not much,
but it was a living. I always admired De Niro and I thought I could be like
him."

"I was just a kid who liked movies. I worked at a video rental place and it was
the best job of my life. I would sit around all day watching movies."

"I grew up on a farm back where the sun rises. I bred a horse once and it was a
real daisy."

They sipped on their drinks as another night rolled over the hills.
