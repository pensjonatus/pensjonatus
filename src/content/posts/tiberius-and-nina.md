"Wat you playin' at, girl?"

Tiberius was sitting on the stairs leading up to the second floor. Somebody had written WATCH YOUR STEP on them. Nina waved her hand around as if to wave him off and then say talk to the hand. Then she left.

Tiberius was upset. He wanted to shout "Bitch," but he did not. She was not a bitch. He got up to leave the building.

A door opened, the last door before the mailboxes. An old man leaned out.

"That girl. Why is she so mean to you?" The man spoke with a strong Polish accent.

"Fuck you, cracker," said Tiberius, not breaking his stride.

He was out in the street. He could have told the old man Nina was a spoiled brat, but she was not. The reality was, they had to play a game before they could be together. Would the old Polack understand that?
