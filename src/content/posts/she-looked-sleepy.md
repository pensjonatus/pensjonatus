I was working behind the counter at the gas station. It was really early in the
morning one fall and everything outside was a wall of grey mist. A dirty-red
pickup pulled up by the store and a girl got out on the passenger side. She came
in to getÂ a few items off the shelves.

She made her way to the counter.. She was really pretty, pretty enough to be a
stripper. But she looked too beaten down for it, her eyes were blood shot and
she looked really sleepy. She spoke in a tired voice.

"Can I also get some Lucky Strikes?" the horn of the pickup sounded outside,
muffled by the mist, "And a lottery ticket."

She paid and left. Disappeared into the pickup, and the pickup disappeared into
the mist.
