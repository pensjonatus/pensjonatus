That morning grandpa took his pill and felt better right away. He walked
downstairs on his own and joined us at breakfast. He had eggs and toast, even
though we all knew it was no use, and talked about baseball and summer holidays.
We all had a good laugh, only mom sneaked a few tears into her dishcloth.

I wanted to play someÂ videogames, but grandpa convinced me to play catch for a
little bit and I must admit it was fun. Grandpa had quite an arm for somebody
his age. He told me stories from his childhood. Really short and funny ones. He
also told me his dad used to play with him when grandpa was my age. It must have
been neat when people used to play catch with their sons. So quaint.

Then grandpa took us all to a picnic in the park. Mom cried, as you can imagine,
but grandpa hugged her a lot and she even laughed a little.

Then he spent the rest of the day with mom and dad, talking and drinking brandy.
Finally, when the sun was setting, the pill grandpa had taken in the morning
started working and grandpa got very cozy and sleepy. Dad helped him up to the
room and grandpa died quietly.
