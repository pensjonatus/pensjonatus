"We're leaving for Taiwan," I said. "Everybody, take just one thing."

They were ready in under a minute, I like a good, disciplined family. Everyone
had a thing they wanted to transfer with them and I smiled and nodded at each
and every one of them until I reached my daughter.

"What is this?" I asked.

"It's Francis. I love him. He's coming with us."

"But it's just a moldy old head," I said. "You won't need it in Taiwan."

"Let her keep it," said Jacques.

"Yeah," said Mark, "She's your daughter. She must have the sense too. She knows
what she's doing."

"I agree," said David Number Two, "Francis should be her thing to take to
Taiwan."

"Okay, okay," I said, "You can take the head, but only because your fathers
think it's okay. We will see if it was a good decision."

Her face lit up with joy. "Thank you, daddy."

"You're welcome. Now, what is Taiwan?"

"It's the only place we will ever be happy," she said.

"That's my girl," I said. I was genuinely proud. As she was leaving, I noticed
Jacques wrote his name on her back, only it was spelled Jock.
