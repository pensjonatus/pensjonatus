Jim was cooking up some franks and patties at a barbecue. He was wearing one of
those KISS THE CHEF aprons and whistling along with the music on radio. Around
him people were having fun and he was having fun looking at them. Unfortunately,
the longer he looked at the people, the more patterns his brain began to form.

The first pattern was that most people were joined into couples. That was
slightly sad, as JimÂ was currently single. But, he thought, some of these people
were alone.

Jim focused on a girl. She was tall and beautiful, her eyes alive and full of
joy. Jim knew her and she was a proud single, much like himself. However, she
was good looking, sociable, and cheerful. She would not have a problem finding
somebody. Which was the opposite what Jim could say about himself.

That made him sad, because the pattern forming in his mind was now the
following: everyone either had somebody, or could easily have somebody. Except
for Jim. He was disgusting and he would die alone.

This moment of self-loathing led him to self-destruction. Thinking "look how
gross I am," he let out a very loud burp.
