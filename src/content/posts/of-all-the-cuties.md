I drove to her house to pick her up. At the screen door, she greeted me with a
half-face ironic smile, but then turned it into a cute frown.

"Are you going to wear this shirt and no tie?"

I did not have time to reply, she pulled me into the dark bowels of the house
and led me into her father's room. There was nobody there. She rummaged through
the closet, singing an Alanis Morisette song, and came back with a tie. "There,
put it on."

When I finished tying the knot, she fixed my collar and smiled a full smile of
white teeth. "It looks much better." And then she kissed me. Then again, with
tongue. Things were getting hot. She pushed me back into her father's chair and
sat on top of me. She unzipped me, and then turned back to the desk, got a
condom out of one of the drawers. I put it on quickly.

She helped me inside and started moving up and down, fully clothed. Faster and
faster. Her mouth open next to my ear, she gave a sweet moan and was done in
just a few strokes. I needed more time, but she would not give it to me. It was
done. She looked at me all cat-eyed and satisfied, with a tiny smile. And then
got off me, fixed her clothes. "Come on, we're gonna be late."

I managed to get my dick back in my pants somehow and wobbled after her.
