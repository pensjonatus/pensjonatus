Almost late for work, night shift today, I got out of the apartment and started
briskly down the hall. Suddenly, the lights went out and it was pitch black. We
pull all our resources together in a crisis and rise to the challenge, so I made
a tough face (which nobody could see) and, keeping one hand to the wall, edged
down the hall.

I heard something moving in the dark in front of me. Footsteps. And a clicking
sound.

"Is... Is anyone out there?" I asked.

"Yes, this is Jim Walker," I heard a warm voice say. My blind neighbor.

"Oh, Jim. Be careful, the lights are out."

He giggled. "Well ain't that something."
