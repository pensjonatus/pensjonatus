It started about 4 am one night. I woke up and heard a soft moan, as if somebody was having sex on the other side of the wall. Except there is nobody on the other side of the wall, we live in a house in the mountains and our neighbors are about two miles away. I thought it was just a dream, but it kept repeating.

One night, I woke up in a haze and went to the bathroom. After I did my business, I was about to leave when I caught a glimpse of something fleshy in the mirror. For split second, I thought I saw a woman's bare breasts. And then I heard the moaning again.

I went back to bed, but I could not sleep. Visions of flesh against flesh haunted me. And the moaning. I could almost hear words among the gasps. Seriously, it is no fun being pestered by otherworldly sex noises.

The following day, I was not myself. I chopped firewood angrily and roamed the neighborhood as if I was hypnotized. I even scared some kids who were playing in the woods. All effects of lack of sleep.

The night after that, I left the bedroom and walked from room to room. There was writing on the walls in every one of them. Big slender letters said "cheat on her." Finally, I came to a part of the house that was never there before, old stylish rooms with ancient furniture and works of art. And in the master bedroom I saw a tangled mass of oiled bodies in an orgy. Among them, a girl that looked just like your best friend Becka. She rose up and beckoned me. I heeded her call. I came.

The next morning, inexplicably, I woke up in her apartment. Honey, you have to believe me. I was haunted.
