It was a birthday party at a bar. I was in a circle of people talking about
health, but everybody gradually went away, until one girl was left. She was
young, maybe forty years younger than me, and pretty the way all young girls
are. She was wearing a blouse with thousands of tiny flowers.

"And I also read," she said, "That a guy in the nineteenth century really
criticized electric light. He said natural light comes from the sun and the
stars, but electric light is artificial and it makes the skin go pale. And
scientists now are confirming that natural light comes from atomic fusion in the
furnace of the sun, but electric light comes from burning dead plants and
animals, you know, coal and oil, and so it is also dead. It's zombie light, or
vampire light. That's probably why zombies and vampires are so popular
nowadays."

I looked closer at the pattern on her blouse. Some of the flowers created
unsettling arrangements, like skulls and skeletons in bathtubs using dinosaur
bones to row across a sea of dead bodies. Or maybe it was just the light.

"Excuse me," I said.

"So the dead light flows across a small space, like between your face and the
light bulb, or sometimes is reflected from the mirror. Especially when the room
is flooded with light, like a dressing room."

How did she know I was an actor? The flowery-bones on her blouse also depicted a
dark ritual of sorts with grown-up skeletons raising tiny baby-skeletons towards
a sun made out of skulls and bones and a petrified sea creature.

"Excuse me," I said.

"And the light makes a noise, you know, a buzzing sound, which keeps you from
sleeping. Also, the moths get disoriented. They never fly towards the stars, or
towards the sun if they happen to be awake during the day. Their wings get
burned up."

Some of the skeletons on her blouse were doing strange drugs, pouring liquids
down their eye sockets or putting hallucinogenic icicles through their hand
bones or rib cages, waiting for the bony sun to melt them. Desperate for a fix,
they did not know the sun was cold.

"Excuse me," I said.

"We get nosebleeds, autism, night terrors, paranoia, temporary blindness,
dyslexia, various mental illnesses and disabilities. Well, society calls them
disabilities, but they are really related to electric light and dysfunctions of
the sleep cycle. Unfinished dreams make us anxious and itchy, so we get stressed
and stress manifest itself as all sorts of problems. The world behind the world
seeping through and getting in the way of normal life."

One skeleton was a boy playing a drum. Just a regular drum. Dum, dum, dum, just
a regular drum.
