I emerged on the other end of the wormhole and a sigh of relief escaped my
lungs. Htrae, also known as Reverse Earth, I was finally here.

It was a peculiar place, where grass is blue and the sky is green. Water is hot
and fire is cold. Men have emotional intelligence and women have confidence. Ah,
Htrae. What a hellhole.

But I did not have time to contemplate because the opposite materialized in
front of me. His powers seemed to match mine, though reversed.

"Ah, Nuclear Man," he said, "I've been expecting you."

"That's funny," I quipped, "Because I was not expecting _you_. But I guess this
is how it goes, haha."

"What brings you here?" he asked.

"Well, funny you should ask. I am looking for the one thing I cannot find home.
And I am taking it with me, no questions asked. Or there will be trouble." I
prepared my nuclear powers, just to be on the safe side.

"What is the thing you're looking for, Nuclear Man?"

"The one thing every hero wants. The ultimate bio weapon. The Death Virus."

"The Death Virus?" he was taken aback. "We've sealed it away because nobody
wants it here. Why do you want it?"

"Must you ask? I am a hero after all," I said, "And every hero only wants one
thing. To destroy the world."

"Really?" he was surprised, "That's the opposite here. But I'm afraid I cannot
let you do that. I need to protect my people. And, it turns out, I need to
protect your people too."

"Funny, but I guess this is how it goes, haha." My nuclear light rose up and
illuminated everything around, "Have at you, Outer Man!"
