I was standing at the urinal, doing my business, and all of a sudden I knocked
on the wall. I do not know what made me do it, maybe something I was thinking,
or just the pulse of life. I was surprised at my involuntary action, but I was
even more surprised at what happened next.

Beyond the wall, somebody knocked back. Two knocks, just like me.

I knocked again. Three knocks this time. Hoping to provoke more.

The other side knocked three times. Same rhythm.

I raised my hand again. I hesitated. What if they do not knock anymore. Will I
end up the needy fool? But I went through with it. Knocked three times. Two
knocks together, one afterthought-ish at the end.

Three knocks came back. The crazy rhythm suggested inventiveness and
imagination. Three happy knocks.

I knocked twice.

Two knocks back.

I had long finished my business, so I was just standing there with the thing in
my hand. I knocked again. Just once.

Knock knock came back.

I wanted more. More communication, more reciprocation. But somebody walked in, a
middle-aged tough guy, truck driver type. The unforgiving type. No jokes, no
funky business, no knocking on the wall, regardless of who might be on the other
side.

So I did not knock again. I walked out, leaving the unknown knocker alone and, I
hoped and dreaded, waiting.
