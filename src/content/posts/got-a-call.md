The phone rang. She hesitated to answer because she knew it was him. She knew he would say he still cared about her and he was sorry. He would say he got enough perspective to know he did wrong and he would be faithful from now on. She would not have the strength to tell him she wanted to move on. She knew she would get back with him.

The phone stopped ringing. She went into the kitchen to make herself some chamomile tea. As the water was about to boil, the phone rang again. She knew she had to pick up this time. She ran to the living room.

"Ms. Eagleston," said the man on the phone, "This is the President of the United States of America. We need your help."
