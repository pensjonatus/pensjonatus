The phone rang. She hesitated to answer because she knew it was him. She knew he
would say he still cared about her and he was sorry. He would say he got enough
perspective to know he did wrong and he would be faithful from now on. She would
not have the strength to tell him she wanted to move on. She knew she would get
back with him.

The phone stopped ringing. She went into the kitchen to make herself some
chamomile tea. As the water was about to boil, the phone rang again. She knew
she had to pick up this time. She ran to the living room.

"Ms. Eagleston," said the man on the phone, "This is the President of the United
States of America. We need your help."
