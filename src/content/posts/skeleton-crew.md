We were shocked to see a skeleton sitting behind the desk. We thought it was a
bad joke, a Halloween decoration, until we realized the skeleton was alive. It
spoke:

"Ah, welcome to Pine Grove Cemetery," he said, getting up from behind the desk
and walking forth to greet us. He was using a walking stick. "I am sure you are
here with grave business." Did he snicker? Or does the human skull always look
as if it is smiling? "Are you mourning a recent loss, or planning for the
future?"

Before we stated our business, we inquired about the nature of his being. He
seemed agreeable and understanding, he knew a living skeleton was out of the
ordinary and required an explanation. "I am a reanimated human, 'undead,' if you
will. We dig the graves, mend the fences, rake the leaves, and I am the manager
here. We operate on a skeleton crew," Did he snicker? "But we do not require any
sleep, so it works out quite well."

He was very professional and helped us get a plot for aunt Agatha's final
resting place. He would not answer any questions about his origin, though.
Neither would he tell us who brought him back to... unlife. As we were about to
depart, he said, "Dreadful weather, isn't it. One is chilled to the bone."

Did he snicker?
