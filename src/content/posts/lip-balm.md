I got out of the club and realized it was light outside. What time? I checked my
wrist, my watch had gone missing, but I was too shitfaced to even know when or
how. I stumbled down the block and stopped to lean on a red mailbox.

That is when I saw a girl on the other side of the street. She looked poor, her
clothes were cheap and old. She was probably going to work, one of those people
who get up early so the rest of us can sleep in. Something guys like me will
never understand or appreciate. She stopped for a step and got her lip balm out
of her bag. There was something calming in the way she felt she had time to stop
and do that, instead of keep running.

Two seconds later, she was gone and I scrambled on to find a place where I could
hail a taxi. A new day stretched before me and I knew it would be much different
from her day.
