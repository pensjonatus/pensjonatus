Two men were riding the train into the night.

"Well, it sure is good to be out of the rain," said one, "And almost home." He
looked outside at the golden-lit windows rushing by. Each promised a family
dinner.

"You're right," said the other. "You know, I missed the 6:10 and had to wait for
the 7:20."

"Are you kidding? There's trains out of the city every 15 minutes."

"Yeah, but most of them don't stop in Bedford."

"Oh. Why don't you get a place in the city? You can afford it. You could stay
some nights and avoid the hustle."

"My wife would think I'm screwing around."

"Would you be screwing around?"

"No," he said with hesitation.

"So she doesn't trust you?"

"I don't know. I mean, I've never done anything. And I would never do anything."

"How long have you guys been married?"

"Five years. We were high school sweethearts before that."

"So, you guys have known each other for so long, but she doesn't know if she can
trust you."

The train screamed. It was slowing down to roll gracefully into the next
station.
