Sitting on the balcony overlooking Boylston Street and the Commons, Mack was
smoking. It was a sunny day, and concrete was radiating heat, but the balcony
was nice and shady. The greenery beneath was faded and jaded, people moved
slowly.

Alice appeared in the door frame behind Mack. He could sense her quiet presence.

"What?" he said lazily.

"Shouldn't you go outside? You've been cooped up in this apartment for days."

"I _am_ outside."

"Your phone keeps ringing," she reached out with the phone in her hand. He did
not turn around to take it, did not move at all. "Here," she said.

"Put it back where you found it, Alice. I'll get to it later."

"It's your publisher. He called five times."

"I'll get to it later," he said.

She was quiet for a few breaths. Mack tried to get back to that peaceful place,
but his thoughts wandered to Money and Future.

"Fine," said Alice, "You do what you want."

"I will do what I want, you dumb bitch," he said and turned around, but she was
no longer there. Gone inside.
