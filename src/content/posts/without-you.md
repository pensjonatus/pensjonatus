His wife was out of town, so he could finally sleep in. She would always get up
a 6 and that woke him as well, and even if he tried to get back to sleep, he
could not. But that morning, he woke up around 10, and he did it slowly, the way
he always imagined was natural.

He did the bathroom, then had a piece of toast for breakfast, and sat down in
front of his laptop to get updated. Finally, about an hour later, he was ready
to get to work.

Today on the agenda, writing for the lifestyle blog. He needed three posts to
get him through the week. He started the first one. He typed the following
sentences: "It's so great having running water in the house. It's so great
having food. It's so great" and then he stopped for a minute. He deleted it all
and typed the following instead: "It's great being here when you're not around."

He got up, made himself a cup of coffee and drank it looking outside the window.
The street moved at a slow pace, cars looking for parking spots, people dragging
their kinds around, or going somewhere people go when they are not at work right
before lunchtime. It was a rainy day. He looked at it all, imagining how the
world would react to his blog post.

He got back to the laptop, erased the sentence and typed these words instead:
"It's so great having running water in the house. It's so great having food.
It's so great being able to keep warm on a rainy day like today."
