His wife was out of town, so he could finally sleep in. She would always get up a 6 and that woke him as well, and even if he tried to get back to sleep, he could not. But that morning, he woke up around 10, and he did it slowly, the way he always imagined was natural.

He did the bathroom, then had a piece of toast for breakfast, and sat down in front of his laptop to get updated. Finally, about an hour later, he was ready to get to work.

Today on the agenda, writing for the lifestyle blog. He needed three posts to get him through the week. He started the first one. He typed the following sentences: "It's so great having running water in the house. It's so great having food. It's so great" and then he stopped for a minute. He deleted it all and typedÂ the following instead: "It's great being here when you're not around."

He got up, made himself a cup of coffee and drank it looking outside the window. The street moved at a slow pace, cars looking for parking spots, people dragging their kinds around, or going somewhere people go when they are not at work right before lunchtime. It was a rainy day. He looked at it all, imagining how the world would react to his blog post.

He got back to the laptop, erased the sentence and typed these words instead: "It's so great having running water in the house. It's so great having food. It's so great being able to keep warm on a rainy day like today."
