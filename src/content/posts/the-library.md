After the war, Everett made it a habit to go to the library every day. It had free WiFi, magazines, and movies, plus there were usually no other people. But Everett always went there because ofÂ the books.

Presently, he was sitting in the reading room over a tome on ornithology and he looked up at the librarian who was sitting behind the counter, some distance from him. She was a pleasant-looking woman in her fifties.

"I think," he said, "It was Virginia Woolf who said the breath of freedom was the very spirit of libraries."

"What was that?"

"Nothing."
