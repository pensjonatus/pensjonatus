After the war, Everett made it a habit to go to the library every day. It had
free WiFi, magazines, and movies, plus there were usually no other people. But
Everett always went there because of the books.

Presently, he was sitting in the reading room over a tome on ornithology and he
looked up at the librarian who was sitting behind the counter, some distance
from him. She was a pleasant-looking woman in her fifties.

"I think," he said, "It was Virginia Woolf who said the breath of freedom was
the very spirit of libraries."

"What was that?"

"Nothing."
