I was walking through the park, wearing my Sunday suit and a hat. I managed to
get the hang of it by now. That is walking with only one arm and one leg. I used
a special crutch.

I walked past the swan pond, past the playground, and into a nice shaded path.
There were boulders on oneÂ side of the path and a dinosaur skeleton on the
other. I stopped to look at the skeleton.

One of the many men in lab coats that worked at the park approached me.

"Sir, would you like to hear about the great old animal, whose bones are on
display?"

"No, thanks," I said politely. "Sorry."

"That's okay," said the man in the lab coat, "Would you like to win a free
five-dollar gift card for the food court?"

"Sure," I said out of guilt.

"Great," said the man and got a piece of paper out of his pocket. "Ah, this is a
military question," he said, "Are you a military man?"

"Was for 27 years," I said.

He eyed my missing arm and leg. "Right," he said. "The questions is: name four
pairs of things in the military."

"Officer and private," I said right away.

"Good, go on."

"Attacker and defender."

"Yes, it's on the list."

"Inspector and inspected."

"Good, good."

"Aaaaand..." I thought and thought and thought. "I don't know any more," I said,
"Sorry."

"That's okay," said the man in the lab coat. "But tell you what, I can still
give you the three-dollar consolation prize. Would you like that?"

"Sure."

"What's the name of the great old animal."

"It's a dinosaur."

"Congratulations!" said the man.

I was so happy, I hopped up and down, up and down.
