# 1.

Tommy and Becka had gone to school and I was enjoying some quiet breakfast with
Melanie, toast and jam, eggs, and coffee. I was reading something on the tablet
while chewing slowly, each bite needs 36 times. Melanie was up and about,
putting dishes in the washer, watering the plants, etc.

"Look," she said from the window, "There's someone moving in, I can see the
truck downstairs. They're carrying all this furniture in, and boxes. Should we
welcome them?"

"Nah, they probably want privacy. People downtown are not the same as in the
suburbs, Mel."

"Right," she nodded. "What are you reading?"

"Another ban on video games, this time it's because of racism. Apparently,
they-"

"It's about Tommy," she cut me off, "His teacher called me at work yesterday.
He's been in a fight."

"Oh, boy," I put the tablet down, "Did he get beat up?"

"No, he actually beat up two other kids."

"So unlike me," I said, "I always got the shit kicked out of me. What was the
fight about?"

"Some kids were making fun of his gym clothes. Saying his shorts are too short."

"And he blew up over that?"

"The teacher told me how it went down," said Melanie, "Apparently, they were
calling him gay. They were saying the f word and suggesting he was trying to
make them horny with the short shorts and that it was not gonna work on them. He
lashed out and attacked a group of five boys. He put two down and the rest took
off."

"Put two down?"

"The teacher's words," said Melanie. "She said it was like he was Jason Bourne."

"Well, I think it's kind of cool," I said, "I wonder where he learned the
moves."

"Tom, that's nothing to be proud of. Violence is not the answer."

I nodded. "Agreed. But what should he have done? This really provoked him, so
maybe there is a hidden reason. Like, I don't know, but it might be serious."

"You should talk to him."

"Me? Why me?"

"Because. You're a man too. You've always had a good relationship with him. He
listens to you."

"Yeah, you're right."

"Anyway, I have to go to work." She was putting her jacket on, grabbing the
purse as she put her arm through the sleeve to save time. "Have a good day,
honey. And don't work too hard."

"I won't," I said and she slammed the door behind her.

Something woke me up in the middle of the night. Windows cast translucent orange
shapes onto the wall which made me think of the empty streets below. It was
quiet. I could tell Melanie was not sleeping.

"Mel, are you asleep?" I said.

"Nah, did you hear that?"

"Hear what? Something woke me up, not sure what."

"It was like a whistle, or a scream." We could sort of hear a piercing shriek
for a couple seconds. "There it is again," she said, "You did hear it, didn't
you?"

"Yeah, I've been hearing it throughout the day. I think it's the new neighbors
that just moved in."

"What?"

"Yeah, I'd never heard it before, so it's gotta be them."

"Huh," she said.

"It's not that bad. I think they're two floors down. Or up. I can't tell."

"Did you talk to Tommy?" she asked.

"Not yet."

"Well?"

"I'm gonna. Soon. I promise."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow. I promise."

"Okay."

In the street below, I heard police sirens, but they passed us by.

# 3.

I was in the lobby, picking up the mail. Some bills and a check from my
publisher. I opened the envelope, it was not much, not worth mentioning really.
Mr. Kazadoukis walked in from the street with his usual grim look.

"Morning," I said, smiling.

"Morning," he said, tipping his hat the old-fashioned way. "Are they screaming
again?"

"To be honest, I think I'm getting used to it," I said, "I don't even notice
anymore."

Mr. K. shook his head in disbelief. "I can't believe we have neighbors like
that. I just can't believe it."

"Neighbors like what?" I asked.

"Never mind. How is your son? How's Tom Jr.?"

"Tommy's fine," I said. "He's been doing well at school. We would like to send
him to theater camp for the summer."

"Don't you think he's had enough of that kind of thing already?"

"What do you mean by that?" I asked, a little angry, but not really meaning to
sound harsh.

"Well, you know. Never mind."

"No, sir, please tell me. What do you mean?"

"Nothing, nothing," Mr. K. was waving his hands, as if saying leave me alone.

"Please, Mr. Kazadoukis, I think my son may be in trouble, and I was wondering
what you meant. Perhaps this could help him."

"Frankly," Mr. K.'s face brightened a little, "I'm sure he'll be alright. He's a
good kid. And how's Becka and your wife Melanie, are they all right?"

"Fine, Mr. K., how about Mrs. K.?"

"She died two years ago," he said, becoming grim again.

"Oh, I'm so sorry. I knew that. Of course I did. I am so sorry."

# 4.

The kids had gone to their rooms after dinner and Melanie and I were sipping
some wine, talking in quiet voices.

"I didn't want to talk about this in front of the kids," she said. "You know, I
went down to the laundry room right after work and while I was there, I heard
the shrieks again. And then one of the girls from 4B came in as well to do the
laundry and we talked about the new neighbors." Melanie leaned in closer to me,
"She says they're ghouls."

"What? Don't be ridiculous. What ghouls, what does she mean?"

"Ghouls, you know. Undead. She says she's not sure, but she studied undead last
semester and those shrieks sound like ghoul calls."

"That's ridiculous? How can she tell, just from the sounds they make? They could
be anything. Anyone."

"Just think about it," she said, "My petunia is completely dead. I did not
change anything, keep watering her like I used to, but she's all brown and the
earth is dry as dust."

"Those are just old wives tales," I said, "There is no scientific evidence that
ghouls can cause anything like that. There are whole communities where the
undead live next to the living. There's never any problems."

She shook her head in disbelief. "I don't want to be like that," she said, "I'm
just worried about the kids."

"I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. If anything bad was happening, there's
the police."

"I guess you're right," she said. "By the way, have you talked to Tommy?"

"Not yet," I said.

"Well, there's no time like the present," she said, with a little swoosh with
her fist to indicate vigor.

So I went down the hall to Tommy's room. The door was ajar.

"Knock, knock, can I come in?"

"Sure, dad." Tommy was on the computer, watching a video of someone playing a
game, he paused it and took his headphones off. "What's up?" he said with a sad
smile.

"Nothing, I just wanted to talk." I sat on his bed and picked up a book from the
shelf, trying to look casual. "Hey, your room looks really clean and tidy.
What's this book? _Coraline_? Have you read this?"

"Yes, it's a spooky story. I got it from Jessica Pavlovsky from school."

"I know the story, I used to love it when I was growing up. Wow, that takes me
back."

He smiled politely. He was such a good kid.

"So Jessica, huh?" I tried to sound casual, but quite possibly I failed
miserably. "Is she in your class?"

"Yeah, we take history together. I like her, she's okay."

"Is she just a friend, or?"

"Just a friend," he hung his head.

"Yeah, that's," I said, but did not know how to finish. That's okay? That's too
bad? That's sad? That's a giraffe? What makes me so bad at talking to this kid
when he's so accommodating, like an adult. Where is his rebellion? "Anyway, I'll
get out of your hair now," I said.

He put his headphones back on and got back to the video and I left, happy there
was a girl. Somehow, it felt like less drama was coming on the account that it
was a girl. I am not sure why, though. Girls are plenty of drama too.

I passed by Becka's room, the door was wide open, so I stopped by. Doing my
one-on-ones with the kids, apparently. So Becka, any progress on the Henderson
report, I should say. "Hey, Pumpkin, how are you tonight?"

"I'm fine, daddy. Playing with Molly and Azure," she said, referring to the
dolls. Normal dolls, not possessed ones, and no imaginary friends. This is not
that kind of story.

"Anything on the agenda for the weekend?" I asked.

"Yes, I almost forgot, Hazira would like us to play together. Her mom will be
over to talk to you."

"Hazira?" I asked, "Who's Hazira?"

"She's the new girl in the building."

"Huh. Does she also go to your school?"

"No, daddy. She goes to Bertram, for music." She gestured like she was playing
the flute.

"Oh, so what's she like? Hazura. Is she your age?"

"Hazira," she said. "Hazira looks my age and acts it. But I think she may be
older. Well, I don't know."

"What do her parents do?"

"I dunno," she shrugged.

"Okay, I'll talk to Hazura's mommy when she gets here."

"Hazira's" she hollered.

# 5.

Melanie woke me up in the middle of the night. "I just had a bad dream."

"What?" I said.

"Not a natural one. It was really creepy. In the dream, I had a knife and," I
dozed off as we was talking, she woke me up again, "Are you even listening to
me?"

"Uh-huh," I said, "Just a few more minutes, okay?"

I feel into deep sleep, like I was drifting down into murky water. The I
realized it was actually sand, and I was in some old ruins in the middle of the
desert. I was dead, not much more than a skeleton. But I quickened whenever
somebody entered the ruins. I raised a rusty spear and joined the other undead
in stalking the intruder. We looked menacingly from walls and towers, we sneaked
around ancient walkways and corridors. We haunted.

I woke up well rested.

# 6.

"So Mrs. Noomspa came over today," I said over dinner, "She wants Becka to come
over on a play date this Saturday. She's really nice."

"Who's Mrs. Noomspa?" Melanie asked.

"She's the," I said, "They're the new neighbors. He's an architect and she's a
homemaker."

"Oh, the new neighbors," said Melanie. "Do you think it's a good idea for Becka
to play over there? I mean, they're so... new."

"It's fine. Becka and Hazira really hit it off, apparently. And Mrs. Noomspa,
Jane, is so nice."

"So is she?" Melanie made a gesture in front of her face.

"What? Undead?" Tommy said.

"I meant," Melanie said, but he cut her off.

"You're all the same, aren't you. You hate the undead, admit it."

"Now, Tommy," I said, "Your mom does not _hate_ the undead."

"Of course I don't hate them. It's just, haven't you heard the news? A vampire
killed his piano student last week."

"That's just one story," said Tommy very animated, "There's plenty of others.
Nothing wrong happening."

"Well yeah," Melanie said, "But shouldn't we be careful? I mean, there's a
chance they will turn her into one of them. These things happen. And if there's
a chance, we should be careful and avoid those situations."

"Turn her into what? Do you even know what they are, mom?"

"I... aren't they ghouls?"

"What's even a ghoul? What do you think this is, a picture book?"

"Now, Tommy, calm down," I said.

"No, dad. Ghoul is a slur, it doesn't mean anything. There's no such thing as
ghouls, not for real. Even when you say vampire, that's a generalization. There
are Maccata, and Bruxa, and Quetzalinia, and Strega. They are not the same
thing. And if you must know, the Noomspas are Skinwalkers. The father is, at
least. Mrs. Noomspa is a human and Hazira is mixed race. You cannot _turn_ into
a Skinwalker."

Melanie had her face in her hands, and I wondered if she was crying. And if she
was, what should I say to Tommy? Go to your room? Apologize to your mother?
Luckily, Melanie revealed her face, and she was sad but not crying, "I'm sorry,
Tommy. I didn't mean to."

"I know, mom," Tommy was calm now, digging through his potatoes with the fork.
"I'm sorry too."

"I just think somebody should do something," Melanie said.

# 7.

Melanie and I were seeing the Tommy's teacher in her office. Mrs. Wilson looked
like she had given up on life, and I am sure there was a story there, but I did
not have the time to get into that. She called us urgently to speak to both of
us. The kids were with Mr. and Mrs. K.

"I found this," the teacher said, "It fell out of Tommy's bag." There was a
plain brass top on her desk. It looked Eastern-European.

"What is this?" Melanie asked.

"It's an amulet that grants the owner a skill. I think it gives Tommy a certain
skill in unarmed combat."

"It what?" I said.

"Mr. and Mrs. Baker, these things are strictly forbidden on school grounds.
Where did your son get an artifact this strong? Is it yours?"

"No," I said, "I've never owned a magic item in my life. I could never afford
it. Well, small things, you know. But never this strong. Is it ancient?"

"It doesn't look ancient," said Mrs. Wilson, "It looks like it was smuggled in
from beyond the Veil. The magic is ancient, though. It's a spell from before the
Joining, known to the Others for centuries. I have no idea how it got here, but
I can tell you one thing, your son should be suspended for this."

"Should be," I said, "But we would not be talking if he was. I mean, it's not a
done deal, is it?"

She sighed and I sensed an entire life's worth of pain in the sigh, but I did
not have time for that. "Tommy, is a really good student. He is a great person,
period. That's why I think he does not deserve punishment. He needs some
guidance. Some instruction. Something the parents should provide."

"Isn't that what we're paying you for?" Melanie asked.

"Mel, please," I said.

"No, I'm being serious. We pay taxes that pay your salary, Mrs. Wilson.
Shouldn't you take care of it? Isn't that what school is for? Instead, you have
the audacity to criticize the way I bring up my children?"

Mrs. Wilson hung her head and sighed, and she sounded even more miserable this
time. As if she was saying Here we go again. Then she looked at us with her
tired eyes, put her hand on the top, and said "I'm keeping this."

# 8.

I was at a bar, drinking. Tommy was at the hospital, a block down, but I just
couldn't stand another minute there. A group of blue-collar guys were drinking
next to me, having fun. I could barely take their merriment.

Suddenly, they went all quiet and listened to the news, and then one of them, a
rowdy uncle uncle type, said, "Well, I'm glad I'm not this boy's father. Can you
imagine that?"

"This would never happen to your boy, Jim. It's insane what happened."

"They say his girlfriend got him into it."

"They say he was gay and couldn't take it, that's why he did it."

"No, there was definitely a girl in the story. A necromancer. She gave him the
spell."

"Twelve students, can you imagine that?"

"Twelve students and a teacher, who was trying to stop him."

"Poor kids, their souls trapped forever because some faggot kid could not come
out of the closet."

"Poor kids _and_ teacher."

"And teacher. These things never used to happen, did they?"
