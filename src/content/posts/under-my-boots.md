I kicked the guy's teeth in. He hit the floor. He must have passed out before he
did, though, because he fell like a rag doll. I turned to the other one.

"You thinking of something?"

"No, man."

"You want to get some."

"No, man," he raised his hands in a defensive gesture. It was a soothing sight.

"Then fuck off."

He started to scuttle away.

"Hey," I shouted, "You better take your friend. Take this piece of shit out of
here. He's bleeding all over the playground. There's gonna be kids here in a
couple of hours."

He tried to pick the guy up and that made me angry, so I kicked him in the head.
He fell into the sandbox.

"Fucking fatass," I was raging, "You should seriously consider salads, you fat
fuck. And another thing..."

He was squirming with pain, so I did not finish. I was just hoping more stuff
like that was going to happen before the sun rose. I was a vampire of the night.
Scary. I was young.
