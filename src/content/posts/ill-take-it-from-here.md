"She's probably gonna be hungry," said the text from my boss, "So take her out
to dinner and keep her company and I will get there after this thing." So there
I was, at a restaurant full of cozy darkness, with her.

She never let silence fall, she always had something to say. And she was full of
energy, not like I thought her to be when I saw her get in and out of my car.
"And then I read it again," she said laughing, "The story about the lady in the
room with the yellow wallpaper. And again and again. Ever since that day, it has
been my favorite story."

I laughed too. She was so literary. Only being literary made sense in my world,
where I either drove people from place to place, or read books waiting for them.
Apart from being literary, she was also beautiful, with dark round eyes. And
kind, talking to me like she did.

"Anyway, what do _you_ like to read?" she asked.

I was about to tell her, but then my boss appeared.

"Are you having a good time?" he asked her, but did not wait for a reply, "Good,
I got the taxi waiting. Let's go."

As they were walking out, he said to me without turning around. "You can have
the night off, I'll take it from here."
