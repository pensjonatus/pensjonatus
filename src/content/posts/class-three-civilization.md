On Kardashev's scale, a class-three civilization is one that can control its entire galaxy. To humans, meeting creatures from a civilization like that would be like meeting gods.

My experience with highly advanced creatures was that they rudely interrupted my lunch with their God-awful noise. I could only suspect what they were doing, as my brain is not capable of the level of reasoning necessary to comprehend. Nonetheless, I suspected it was not good. Nothing in my life up to that point had prepared me for what was about to happen. My whole world was about to be destroyed and transformed into resources they needed.

I panicked and ran around my house frantically, I jumped to my family trying to make them safe somehow, but how could I do that?

The air was suddenly filled with an unnatural smell. The sun was obscured by clouds of smoke. Everything began to tremble. Then a loud crack like I had never heard before and the noise subsided. Piece only lasted a fraction of a second before I was flung to the side. Gravity had shifted, sending me adrift. My family looked at me, their eyes filled with fear. I could not help them.

My descent into the unknown continued and I was flung out of my world and onto an alien green expanse. A green surface was nearing fast, too fast for safety. Smack!

Somehow, I survived the fall. Were they trying to save me? I doubted that, as the green expanse seemed lifeless, devoid of anything I could use to find shelter or to nurture myself. I would be dead soon.

But what did I know? I was just a squirrel and those damn humans cut down my tree. I am not a spiteful squirrel, but I hope a class-three civilization comes and does to them what they did to me.
