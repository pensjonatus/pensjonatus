Eating poisonous fish was the last thing he ever did. It was the end of a very
eventful night which started with a bungee jump. He went to the peer with his
friends where somebody had set up a tall crane you could jump off of. After much
hesitation, he did.

"You know me, Dory, I am not much for extreme sports. I guess I value my
survival too much," he said.

But then one hour after it was done he realized all he could think about was
that rush. He said so to his friends with whom he was drinking beers at the
time, and he made them get up and get back to the peer in search of more
attractions.

There was some scuba diving, but he did not enjoy that. It was too benign. He
wanted to get into deep sea diving, but the guy told him it took a few weeks to
get a license.

"I might not be alive in a few weeks," he said to the guy.

So he went downtown and picked a fight with a scary-looking local cutthroat. He
beat the guy up and left him in the street. Then he stole a car and drove to
Chinatown. He had sex with a prostitute and then robbed a bank with a gun he
stole from her. He gambled all that money away within the following two hours
and ended up at a Japanese restaurant.

"This fish is very poisonous," said the restaurant owner, "You can only eat a
small fragment of it. And only if it had been killed properly, you see?
Otherwise, the venom gets into your blood and you die."

At first, the owner refused to serve him the entire fish, but the gun convinced
him. So our hero was eating the poisonous fish whole when all of a sudden the
cutthroat he beat up showed up with his tattooed friends. Guns were drawn and
our hero was shot dead.

They missed him in the realtors' meeting the following morning.
