Imagine yourself speeding. You are in your car, going just above the limit, trying to get home as soon as possible. There is no emergency, it is just another day and you are getting back from work. Nobody is waiting for you more than any other day. Maybe your wife called you asking when you will be home because you stayed a bit too long and she does not mean anything, she just wants to know, but you feel rushed.

Everybody is leaving work and going home, so the streets are packed. You had trouble getting through, but right now you found a straight, empty stretch of road and you floored it. You are making up for lost time.

Now imagine somebody steps onto the pavement in front of your car. Turns to face you. Kneels down. Extends their head to meet your bumper. Did they ever think what this would do to your trip home? Or to all your subsequent trips home?
