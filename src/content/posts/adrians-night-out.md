Adrian noticed that after a few drinks, the place got a lot more classy. The dim
barlight, the music, especially the company. She leaned closer to Adrian and
smiled, then blew him a kiss.

"So what do you say, baby?" she said, "Another drink?"

"Yeah," he said opening his wallet to see if there was any money left, "Why
not?"

She reached out and grabbed a photo that was sticking out of one of the
compartments. "Hey, is that your girlfriend?"

Adrian wanted to tear the picture out of her hand but he missed. No matter, he
would use words instead, no matter how garbled they would come out: "It's my
fiancee. We're getting married soon, so don't get any bright ideas."

She chuckled. "Baby, I'm much prettier than her, can't you tell?" She smiled and
blew another kiss. He imagined her raspy voice whispering into his ear among the
white sheets of a hotel bed.

"I love her," he tried to defend himself, but he knew he was going to fail.

"You deserve someone better. Someone sexier," she said.

"Do I?" he asked, getting sad all of a sudden. Getting married to one woman
meant he would never get to find out about another. He would have to stick with
one, watch her get older and lose interest, have boring sex and die a few weeks
after her because the undying feeling would make him miserable. Helpless.

At the sight of his sudden spell of sadness, she seemed to sober up a little.
She leaned back and said, "What am I doing here? This is not me."

He sighed. He knew how the night was going to end. The right way.
