I have a little secret, and I will tell you.

I saw a beautiful woman at the airport. She was stand offish, probably used to
men hurting her. I would not hurt her, because she does not matter to me. But I
have hurt others.

I don't care what they feel, you see.

No, I am not a serial killer. I am a man who always leaves the toilet seat up.
Buahahahahaha.
