I was having supper at the hotel restaurant. I noticed a couple, he was a business type in a suit, she was young and sexy. I figured they were about to finish eating and go upstairs to have sex. Or go out before they come back to have sex. Either way, sex was going to happen, I was certain.

I had to prepare slides for the following day and get a good night's sleep. No sex for me, unless I pay to see girls on TV. Hotel wifi is no good for streaming porn.

I thought about taking my wife to a place like this but I knew it was silly. And besides, we would probably not have sex anyway because she would not like to get the sheets dirty. The staff could make comments when they were cleaning up the next day.

But if we did have supper in the hotel restaurant together, would somebody sit in the corner and look at us with longing?
