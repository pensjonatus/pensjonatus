The way I understand it, full-stack means I have experience creating web
applications. I feel the most comfortable using the following tech:

- React, JS, Typescript
- Express.js
- Postgres, mySQL, ORMs

I've also dabbled in:

- Python
- C#
- Java

## Notable achievements

Let me not be humble for a minute and appreciate myself. This is for my mental
health, but also for potential employers or business partners. I've done some
stuff:

- I have been building tools and strategies for ContentOps since 2008.
- I was one of the original co-founders of "soap! technical writing conference"
  (all lowercase). The organizers have taken it to new heights since I left and
  I cannot take any credit for its greatness. Still I cannot forget this part of
  my life, it's important to me.
- I am a contributor to and maintainer of the https://techwriter.pl blog.
- I am a co-owner and co-host of the https://techwriterkoduje.pl podcast.
- I used to be on the board of ITCQF. It was an organization which trained tech
  writers. It also issued tech writing certificates across Europe.
- I served as Technical Director (and site manager) of 3di Poland when it first
  opened in Krakow. I played a major role in setting up the Polish branch and
  making it profitable.
- I used to teach a tech writing class at AGH University of Science and
  Technology. It was part of a post-diploma course for managers in the software
  industry
- I am an experienced public speaker. I've given many public presentations at
  conferences and meetups. I've also run training sessions, workshops, and
  webinars.

## Hobbies

- Writing flash fiction.
- Dark Souls - if you know, you know.
- Watching movies and reading books.

## Contact

You can find me on Linkedin. I should also not be that hard to Google. At the
time of writing this, I live in Krakow, Poland.
