# Paweł Kowaluk

I am a full-stack developer who specializes in tooling for technical documentation. That means I have knowledge and experience of tools used in technical writing.

## Skills

- Static site generators
- DevOps and dpeloying web apps
- Webmastering, hosting, DNS, all of that
- Managing versions of docs
- Creating pipelines for translation and localization
- Content strategy (this is just one bullet point, but man! if you know the number of things that go into it, you know it's not just a single skill)
- ContentOps
- Managing teams and projects
- Softawre architecture
- Database design

## Tech stack

Full-stack here means I have experience creating web applications. The tech I know most about is:

- React, JS, Typescipt
- Next.js
- Astro
- Express.js
- Postgres, mySQL

I've also dabbled in:

- Python
- C# and the whole Windows stack
- Java (literally two commercial projects, so not a lot really)
- AIs with LLM - I've created more chatbots and LLM pipelines that I can even list, and I learned along the way. I started around 2016 in the pre-LLM days, learning about multinomial regression and all that basic stuff. In the LLM world I've used langchain and related tech to build RAG apps.

## Notable achievements

Let me not be humble for a minute and appreciate myself. This is for my mental health, but also for potential employers or business partners. I've done some stuff:

- I have been building tools and strategies for ContentOps since 2008.
- I was one of the original co-founders of "soap! technical writing conference" (sic!) - though these guys have taken it to absolutely new heights since I left and I cannot take any credit for its greatness. Still I cannot just forget this part of my life, it's really important to me.
- I am a contributor to and maintaner of the https://techwriter.pl blog.
- I am a co-host of Michał Skowron's https://techwriterkoduje.pl podcast.
- I am on the board of ITCQF, an organization which trains tech writers and issues tech writing certificates across Europe.
- I served as Technical Director (and site manager) of 3di poland when it first opened in Krakow. I played a major role in setting up the Polish branch and making it profitable.
- I used to teach a tech writing class in a post-diploma course for managers in the software industry at AGH University of Science and tecnhology.
- I consider myself an expert public speaker with countless public presentations, private boardroom presentations, and meetings with clients. I've also run training sessions, workshops, and webinars.

  ## Hobbies

  - Writing, mostly flash fiction.
  - Joke web apps (web apps which make me laugh, like a chatbot that spews out random words and promises they are true in some universe, or a clock that counts down seconds until you can retire).
  - Dark Souls - if you know, you know.
  - Watching deep movies and reading deep books. Yeah, because I'm deep.
  - I used to have a YouTube channel with solo comedy skits, though that's not online anymore.
